# Define services in Docker Compose (part 7 of 7)

### `uts`

`uts` configures the UTS namespace mode set for the service container. When unspecified
it is the runtime's decision to assign a UTS namespace, if supported. Available values are:

- `'host'`: Results in the container using the same UTS namespace as the host.

```yml
    uts: "host"
```

### `volumes`

The `volumes` attribute define mount host paths or named volumes that are accessible by service containers. You can use `volumes` to define multiple types of mounts; `volume`, `bind`, `tmpfs`, or `npipe`.

If the mount is a host path and is only used by a single service, it can be declared as part of the service
definition. To reuse a volume across multiple services, a named
volume must be declared in the `volumes` top-level element.

The following example shows a named volume (`db-data`) being used by the `backend` service,
and a bind mount defined for a single service.

```yml
services:
  backend:
    image: example/backend
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: db-data
        target: /data
        volume:
          nocopy: true
          subpath: sub
      - type: bind
        source: /var/run/postgres/postgres.sock
        target: /var/run/postgres/postgres.sock

volumes:
  db-data:
```

For more information about the `volumes` top-level element, see Volumes.

#### Short syntax

The short syntax uses a single string with colon-separated values to specify a volume mount
(`VOLUME:CONTAINER_PATH`), or an access mode (`VOLUME:CONTAINER_PATH:ACCESS_MODE`).

- `VOLUME`: Can be either a host path on the platform hosting containers (bind mount) or a volume name.
- `CONTAINER_PATH`: The path in the container where the volume is mounted.
- `ACCESS_MODE`: A comma-separated `,` list of options:
  - `rw`: Read and write access. This is the default if none is specified.
  - `ro`: Read-only access.
  - `z`: SELinux option indicating that the bind mount host content is shared among multiple containers.
  - `Z`: SELinux option indicating that the bind mount host content is private and unshared for other containers.

> **Note:**
>
> The SELinux re-labeling bind mount option is ignored on platforms without SELinux.

> **Note:**
> Relative host paths are only supported by Compose that deploy to a
> local container runtime. This is because the relative path is resolved from the Compose file’s parent
> directory which is only applicable in the local case. When Compose deploys to a non-local
> platform it rejects Compose files which use relative host paths with an error. To avoid ambiguities
> with named volumes, relative paths should always begin with `.` or `..`.

> **Note:**
>
> For bind mounts, the short syntax creates a directory at the source path on the host if it doesn't exist. This is for backward compatibility with `docker-compose` legacy.
> It can be prevented by using long syntax and setting `create_host_path` to `false`.

#### Long syntax

The long form syntax lets you configure additional fields that can't be
expressed in the short form.

- `type`: The mount type. Either `volume`, `bind`, `tmpfs`, `image`, `npipe`, or `cluster`
- `source`: The source of the mount, a path on the host for a bind mount, a Docker image reference for an image mount, or the
  name of a volume defined in the
  top-level `volumes` key. Not applicable for a tmpfs mount.
- `target`: The path in the container where the volume is mounted.
- `read_only`: Flag to set the volume as read-only.
- `bind`: Used to configure additional bind options:
  - `propagation`: The propagation mode used for the bind.
  - `create_host_path`: Creates a directory at the source path on host if there is nothing present. Defaults to `true`.
  - `selinux`: The SELinux re-labeling option `z` (shared) or `Z` (private)
- `volume`: Configures additional volume options:
  - `nocopy`: Flag to disable copying of data from a container when a volume is created.
  - `subpath`: Path inside a volume to mount instead of the volume root.
- `tmpfs`: Configures additional tmpfs options:
  - `size`: The size for the tmpfs mount in bytes (either numeric or as bytes unit).
  - `mode`: The file mode for the tmpfs mount as Unix permission bits as an octal number. Introduced in Docker Compose version 2.14.0.
- `image`: Configures additional image options:
  - `subpath`: Path inside the source image to mount instead of the image root. Available in Docker Compose version 2.35.0
- `consistency`: The consistency requirements of the mount. Available values are platform specific.

> **Tip:**
>
> Working with large repositories or monorepos, or with virtual file systems that are no longer scaling with your codebase?
> Compose now takes advantage of Synchronized file shares and automatically creates file shares for bind mounts.
> Ensure you're signed in to Docker with a paid subscription and have enabled both **Access experimental features** and **Manage Synchronized file shares with Compose** in Docker Desktop's settings.

### `volumes_from`

`volumes_from` mounts all of the volumes from another service or container. You can optionally specify
read-only access `ro` or read-write `rw`. If no access level is specified, then read-write access is used.

You can also mount volumes from a container that is not managed by Compose by using the `container:` prefix.

```yaml
volumes_from:
  - service_name
  - service_name:ro
  - container:container_name
  - container:container_name:rw
```

### `working_dir`

`working_dir` overrides the container's working directory which is specified by the image, for example Dockerfile's `WORKDIR`.
