### Disambiguating Between Identically Named Methods

Nothing in Rust prevents a trait from having a method with the same name as
another trait’s method, nor does Rust prevent you from implementing both traits
on one type. It’s also possible to implement a method directly on the type with
the same name as methods from traits.

When calling methods with the same name, you’ll need to tell Rust which one you
want to use. Consider the code in Listing 20-17 where we’ve defined two traits,
`Pilot` and `Wizard`, that both have a method called `fly`. We then implement
both traits on a type `Human` that already has a method named `fly` implemented
on it. Each `fly` method does something different.

**Listing 20-17: Two traits are defined to have a `fly` method and are implemented on the `Human` type, and a `fly` method is implemented on `Human` directly.** (src/main.rs)

```rust
trait Pilot {
    fn fly(&self);
}

trait Wizard {
    fn fly(&self);
}

struct Human;

impl Pilot for Human {
    fn fly(&self) {
        println!("This is your captain speaking.");
    }
}

impl Wizard for Human {
    fn fly(&self) {
        println!("Up!");
    }
}

impl Human {
    fn fly(&self) {
        println!("*waving arms furiously*");
    }
}
```

When we call `fly` on an instance of `Human`, the compiler defaults to calling
the method that is directly implemented on the type, as shown in Listing 20-18.

**Listing 20-18: Calling `fly` on an instance of `Human`** (src/main.rs)

```rust
fn main() {
    let person = Human;
    person.fly();
}
```

Running this code will print `*waving arms furiously*`, showing that Rust
called the `fly` method implemented on `Human` directly.

To call the `fly` methods from either the `Pilot` trait or the `Wizard` trait,
we need to use more explicit syntax to specify which `fly` method we mean.
Listing 20-19 demonstrates this syntax.

**Listing 20-19: Specifying which trait’s `fly` method we want to call** (src/main.rs)

```rust
fn main() {
    let person = Human;
    Pilot::fly(&person);
    Wizard::fly(&person);
    person.fly();
}
```

Specifying the trait name before the method name clarifies to Rust which
implementation of `fly` we want to call. We could also write
`Human::fly(&person)`, which is equivalent to the `person.fly()` that we used
in Listing 20-19, but this is a bit longer to write if we don’t need to
disambiguate.

Running this code prints the following:

```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling traits-example v0.1.0 (file:///projects/traits-example)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.46s
     Running `target/debug/traits-example`
This is your captain speaking.
Up!
*waving arms furiously*
```

Because the `fly` method takes a `self` parameter, if we had two _types_ that
both implement one _trait_, Rust could figure out which implementation of a
trait to use based on the type of `self`.

However, associated functions that are not methods don’t have a `self`
parameter. When there are multiple types or traits that define non-method
functions with the same function name, Rust doesn’t always know which type you
mean unless you use fully qualified syntax. For example, in Listing 20-20, we
create a trait for an animal shelter that wants to name all baby dogs Spot. We
make an `Animal` trait with an associated non-method function `baby_name`. The
`Animal` trait is implemented for the struct `Dog`, on which we also provide an
associated non-method function `baby_name` directly.

**Listing 20-20: A trait with an associated function and a type with an associated function of the same name that also implements the trait** (src/main.rs)

```rust
trait Animal {
    fn baby_name() -> String;
}

struct Dog;

impl Dog {
    fn baby_name() -> String {
        String::from("Spot")
    }
}

impl Animal for Dog {
    fn baby_name() -> String {
        String::from("puppy")
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!("A baby dog is called a {}", Dog::baby_name());
}
```

We implement the code for naming all puppies Spot in the `baby_name` associated
function that is defined on `Dog`. The `Dog` type also implements the trait
`Animal`, which describes characteristics that all animals have. Baby dogs are
called puppies, and that is expressed in the implementation of the `Animal`
trait on `Dog` in the `baby_name` function associated with the `Animal` trait.

In `main`, we call the `Dog::baby_name` function, which calls the associated
function defined on `Dog` directly. This code prints the following:

```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling traits-example v0.1.0 (file:///projects/traits-example)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.54s
     Running `target/debug/traits-example`
A baby dog is called a Spot
```

This output isn’t what we wanted. We want to call the `baby_name` function that
is part of the `Animal` trait that we implemented on `Dog` so that the code
prints `A baby dog is called a puppy`. The technique of specifying the trait
name that we used in Listing 20-19 doesn’t help here; if we change `main` to
the code in Listing 20-21, we’ll get a compilation error.

**Listing 20-21: Attempting to call the `baby_name` function from the `Animal` trait, but Rust doesn’t know which implementation to use** (src/main.rs)

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("A baby dog is called a {}", Animal::baby_name());
}
```

Because `Animal::baby_name` doesn’t have a `self` parameter, and there could be
other types that implement the `Animal` trait, Rust can’t figure out which
implementation of `Animal::baby_name` we want. We’ll get this compiler error:

```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling traits-example v0.1.0 (file:///projects/traits-example)

```

To disambiguate and tell Rust that we want to use the implementation of
`Animal` for `Dog` as opposed to the implementation of `Animal` for some other
type, we need to use fully qualified syntax. Listing 20-22 demonstrates how to
use fully qualified syntax.

**Listing 20-22: Using fully qualified syntax to specify that we want to call the `baby_name` function from the `Animal` trait as implemented on `Dog`** (src/main.rs)

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("A baby dog is called a {}", <Dog as Animal>::baby_name());
}
```

We’re providing Rust with a type annotation within the angle brackets, which
indicates we want to call the `baby_name` method from the `Animal` trait as
implemented on `Dog` by saying that we want to treat the `Dog` type as an
`Animal` for this function call. This code will now print what we want:

```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling traits-example v0.1.0 (file:///projects/traits-example)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.48s
     Running `target/debug/traits-example`
A baby dog is called a puppy
```

In general, fully qualified syntax is defined as follows:

```rust
<Type as Trait>::function(receiver_if_method, next_arg, ...);
```

For associated functions that aren’t methods, there would not be a `receiver`:
There would only be the list of other arguments. You could use fully qualified
syntax everywhere that you call functions or methods. However, you’re allowed
to omit any part of this syntax that Rust can figure out from other information
in the program. You only need to use this more verbose syntax in cases where
there are multiple implementations that use the same name and Rust needs help
to identify which implementation you want to call.

### Using Supertraits

Sometimes you might write a trait definition that depends on another trait: For
a type to implement the first trait, you want to require that type to also
implement the second trait. You would do this so that your trait definition can
make use of the associated items of the second trait. The trait your trait
definition is relying on is called a _supertrait_ of your trait.

For example, let’s say we want to make an `OutlinePrint` trait with an
`outline_print` method that will print a given value formatted so that it’s
framed in asterisks. That is, given a `Point` struct that implements the
standard library trait `Display` to result in `(x, y)`, when we call
`outline_print` on a `Point` instance that has `1` for `x` and `3` for `y`, it
should print the following:

```text
**********
*        *
* (1, 3) *
*        *
**********
```

In the implementation of the `outline_print` method, we want to use the
`Display` trait’s functionality. Therefore, we need to specify that the
`OutlinePrint` trait will work only for types that also implement `Display` and
provide the functionality that `OutlinePrint` needs. We can do that in the
trait definition by specifying `OutlinePrint: Display`. This technique is
similar to adding a trait bound to the trait. Listing 20-23 shows an
implementation of the `OutlinePrint` trait.

**Listing 20-23: Implementing the `OutlinePrint` trait that requires the functionality from `Display`** (src/main.rs)

```rust
use std::fmt;

trait OutlinePrint: fmt::Display {
    fn outline_print(&self) {
        let output = self.to_string();
        let len = output.len();
        println!("{}", "*".repeat(len + 4));
        println!("*{}*", " ".repeat(len + 2));
        println!("* {output} *");
        println!("*{}*", " ".repeat(len + 2));
        println!("{}", "*".repeat(len + 4));
    }
}
```

Because we’ve specified that `OutlinePrint` requires the `Display` trait, we
can use the `to_string` function that is automatically implemented for any type
that implements `Display`. If we tried to use `to_string` without adding a
colon and specifying the `Display` trait after the trait name, we’d get an
error saying that no method named `to_string` was found for the type `&Self` in
the current scope.

Let’s see what happens when we try to implement `OutlinePrint` on a type that
doesn’t implement `Display`, such as the `Point` struct:

**Listing** (src/main.rs)

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl OutlinePrint for Point {}
```

We get an error saying that `Display` is required but not implemented:

```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling traits-example v0.1.0 (file:///projects/traits-example)
error[E0277]: `Point` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Display`

   |                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^ required by this bound in `OutlinePrint::outline_print`
 4 |     fn outline_print(&self) {
   |        ------------- required by a bound in this associated function

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0277`.
error: could not compile `traits-example` (bin "traits-example") due to 2 previous errors
```

To fix this, we implement `Display` on `Point` and satisfy the constraint that
`OutlinePrint` requires, like so:

**Listing** (src/main.rs)

```rust
use std::fmt;

impl fmt::Display for Point {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "({}, {})", self.x, self.y)
    }
}
```

Then, implementing the `OutlinePrint` trait on `Point` will compile
successfully, and we can call `outline_print` on a `Point` instance to display
it within an outline of asterisks.
