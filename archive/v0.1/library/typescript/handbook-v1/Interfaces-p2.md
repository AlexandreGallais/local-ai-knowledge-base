# Interfaces (part 2 of 2)

## Indexable Types

Similarly to how we can use interfaces to describe function types, we can also describe types that we can "index into" like `a[10]`, or `ageMap["daniel"]`.
Indexable types have an _index signature_ that describes the types we can use to index into the object, along with the corresponding return types when indexing.

Let's take an example:

```ts
interface StringArray {
  [index: number]: string;
}

let myArray: StringArray;
myArray = ["Bob", "Fred"];

let myStr: string = myArray[0];
```

Above, we have a `StringArray` interface that has an index signature.
This index signature states that when a `StringArray` is indexed with a `number`, it will return a `string`.

There are four types of supported index signatures: string, number, symbol and template strings.
It is possible to support many types of indexers, but the type returned from a numeric indexer must be a subtype of the type returned from the string indexer.

This is because when indexing with a `number`, JavaScript will actually convert that to a `string` before indexing into an object.
That means that indexing with `100` (a `number`) is the same thing as indexing with `"100"` (a `string`), so the two need to be consistent.

```ts
interface Animal {
  name: string;
}

interface Dog extends Animal {
  breed: string;
}

// Error: indexing with a numeric string might get you a completely separate type of Animal!
interface NotOkay {
  [x: number]: Animal;
  [x: string]: Dog;
}
```

While string index signatures are a powerful way to describe the "dictionary" pattern, they also enforce that all properties match their return type.
This is because a string index declares that `obj.property` is also available as `obj["property"]`.
In the following example, `name`'s type does not match the string index's type, and the type checker gives an error:

```ts
interface NumberDictionary {
  [index: string]: number;

  length: number; // ok, length is a number
  name: string; // error, the type of 'name' is not a subtype of the indexer
}
```

However, properties of different types are acceptable if the index signature is a union of the property types:

```ts
interface NumberOrStringDictionary {
  [index: string]: number | string;

  length: number; // ok, length is a number
  name: string; // ok, name is a string
}
```

Finally, you can make index signatures `readonly` in order to prevent assignment to their indices:

```ts
interface ReadonlyStringArray {
  readonly [index: number]: string;
}

let myArray: ReadonlyStringArray = ["Alice", "Bob"];
myArray[2] = "Mallory"; // error!
```

You can't set `myArray[2]` because the index signature is `readonly`.

### Indexable Types with Template Strings

A template string can be used to indicate that a particular pattern is allowed, but not all. For example, a HTTP headers object may have a set list of known headers and support any custom defined properties which are prefixed with `x-`.

```ts

interface HeadersResponse {
  "content-type": string,
  date: string,
  "content-length": string

  // Permit any property starting with 'x-'.
  [headerName: `x-${string}`]: string;
}

function handleResponse(r: HeadersResponse) {
  // Handle known, and x- prefixed
  const type = r["content-type"]
  const poweredBy = r["x-powered-by"]

  // Unknown keys without the prefix raise errors
  const origin = r.origin
}
```

## Class Types

### Implementing an interface

One of the most common uses of interfaces in languages like C# and Java, that of explicitly enforcing that a class meets a particular contract, is also possible in TypeScript.

```ts
interface ClockInterface {
  currentTime: Date;
}

class Clock implements ClockInterface {
  currentTime: Date = new Date();
  constructor(h: number, m: number) {}
}
```

You can also describe methods in an interface that are implemented in the class, as we do with `setTime` in the below example:

```ts
interface ClockInterface {
  currentTime: Date;
  setTime(d: Date): void;
}

class Clock implements ClockInterface {
  currentTime: Date = new Date();
  setTime(d: Date) {
    this.currentTime = d;
  }
  constructor(h: number, m: number) {}
}
```

Interfaces describe the public side of the class, rather than both the public and private side.
This prohibits you from using them to check that a class also has particular types for the private side of the class instance.

### Difference between the static and instance sides of classes

When working with classes and interfaces, it helps to keep in mind that a class has _two_ types: the type of the static side and the type of the instance side.
You may notice that if you create an interface with a construct signature and try to create a class that implements this interface you get an error:

```ts
interface ClockConstructor {
  new (hour: number, minute: number);
}

class Clock implements ClockConstructor {
  currentTime: Date;
  constructor(h: number, m: number) {}
}
```

This is because when a class implements an interface, only the instance side of the class is checked.
Since the constructor sits in the static side, it is not included in this check.

Instead, you would need to work with the static side of the class directly.
In this example, we define two interfaces, `ClockConstructor` for the constructor and `ClockInterface` for the instance methods.
Then, for convenience, we define a constructor function `createClock` that creates instances of the type that is passed to it:

```ts
interface ClockConstructor {
  new (hour: number, minute: number): ClockInterface;
}

interface ClockInterface {
  tick(): void;
}

function createClock(
  ctor: ClockConstructor,
  hour: number,
  minute: number
): ClockInterface {
  return new ctor(hour, minute);
}

class DigitalClock implements ClockInterface {
  constructor(h: number, m: number) {}
  tick() {
    console.log("beep beep");
  }
}

class AnalogClock implements ClockInterface {
  constructor(h: number, m: number) {}
  tick() {
    console.log("tick tock");
  }
}

let digital = createClock(DigitalClock, 12, 17);
let analog = createClock(AnalogClock, 7, 32);
```

Because `createClock`'s first parameter is of type `ClockConstructor`, in `createClock(AnalogClock, 7, 32)`, it checks that `AnalogClock` has the correct constructor signature.

Another simple way is to use class expressions:

```ts
interface ClockConstructor {
  new (hour: number, minute: number): ClockInterface;
}

interface ClockInterface {
  tick(): void;
}

const Clock: ClockConstructor = class Clock implements ClockInterface {
  constructor(h: number, m: number) {}
  tick() {
    console.log("beep beep");
  }
};

let clock = new Clock(12, 17);
clock.tick();
```

## Extending Interfaces

Like classes, interfaces can extend each other.
This allows you to copy the members of one interface into another, which gives you more flexibility in how you separate your interfaces into reusable components.

```ts
interface Shape {
  color: string;
}

interface Square extends Shape {
  sideLength: number;
}

let square = {} as Square;
square.color = "blue";
square.sideLength = 10;
```

An interface can extend multiple interfaces, creating a combination of all of the interfaces.

```ts
interface Shape {
  color: string;
}

interface PenStroke {
  penWidth: number;
}

interface Square extends Shape, PenStroke {
  sideLength: number;
}

let square = {} as Square;
square.color = "blue";
square.sideLength = 10;
square.penWidth = 5.0;
```

## Hybrid Types

As we mentioned earlier, interfaces can describe the rich types present in real world JavaScript.
Because of JavaScript's dynamic and flexible nature, you may occasionally encounter an object that works as a combination of some of the types described above.

One such example is an object that acts as both a function and an object, with additional properties:

```ts
interface Counter {
  (start: number): string;
  interval: number;
  reset(): void;
}

function getCounter(): Counter {
  let counter = function (start: number) {} as Counter;
  counter.interval = 123;
  counter.reset = function () {};
  return counter;
}

let c = getCounter();
c(10);
c.reset();
c.interval = 5.0;
```

When interacting with 3rd-party JavaScript, you may need to use patterns like the above to fully describe the shape of the type.

## Interfaces Extending Classes

When an interface type extends a class type it inherits the members of the class but not their implementations.
It is as if the interface had declared all of the members of the class without providing an implementation.
Interfaces inherit even the private and protected members of a base class.
This means that when you create an interface that extends a class with private or protected members, that interface type can only be implemented by that class or a subclass of it.

This is useful when you have a large inheritance hierarchy, but want to specify that your code works with only subclasses that have certain properties.
The subclasses don't have to be related besides inheriting from the base class.
For example:

```ts
class Control {
  private state: any;
}

interface SelectableControl extends Control {
  select(): void;
}

class Button extends Control implements SelectableControl {
  select() {}
}

class TextBox extends Control {
  select() {}
}

class ImageControl implements SelectableControl {
  private state: any;
  select() {}
}
```

In the above example, `SelectableControl` contains all of the members of `Control`, including the private `state` property.
Since `state` is a private member it is only possible for descendants of `Control` to implement `SelectableControl`.
This is because only descendants of `Control` will have a `state` private member that originates in the same declaration, which is a requirement for private members to be compatible.

Within the `Control` class it is possible to access the `state` private member through an instance of `SelectableControl`.
Effectively, a `SelectableControl` acts like a `Control` that is known to have a `select` method.
The `Button` and `TextBox` classes are subtypes of `SelectableControl` (because they both inherit from `Control` and have a `select` method). The `ImageControl` class has its own `state` private member rather than extending `Control`, so it cannot implement `SelectableControl`.
