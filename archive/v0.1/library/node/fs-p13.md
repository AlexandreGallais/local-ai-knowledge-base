# File system (part 13 of 20)

### `fs.writeFile(file, data[, options], callback)`

* `file` {string|Buffer|URL|integer} filename or file descriptor
* `data` {string|Buffer|TypedArray|DataView}
* `options` {Object|string}
  * `encoding` {string|null} **Default:** `'utf8'`
  * `mode` {integer} **Default:** `0o666`
  * `flag` {string} See support of file system `flags`. **Default:** `'w'`.
  * `flush` {boolean} If all data is successfully written to the file, and
    `flush` is `true`, `fs.fsync()` is used to flush the data.
    **Default:** `false`.
  * `signal` {AbortSignal} allows aborting an in-progress writeFile
* `callback` {Function}
  * `err` {Error|AggregateError}

When `file` is a filename, asynchronously writes data to the file, replacing the
file if it already exists. `data` can be a string or a buffer.

When `file` is a file descriptor, the behavior is similar to calling
`fs.write()` directly (which is recommended). See the notes below on using
a file descriptor.

The `encoding` option is ignored if `data` is a buffer.

The `mode` option only affects the newly created file. See `fs.open()`
for more details.

```mjs
import { writeFile } from 'node:fs';
import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';

const data = new Uint8Array(Buffer.from('Hello Node.js'));
writeFile('message.txt', data, (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('The file has been saved!');
});
```

If `options` is a string, then it specifies the encoding:

```mjs
import { writeFile } from 'node:fs';

writeFile('message.txt', 'Hello Node.js', 'utf8', callback);
```

It is unsafe to use `fs.writeFile()` multiple times on the same file without
waiting for the callback. For this scenario, `fs.createWriteStream()` is
recommended.

Similarly to `fs.readFile` - `fs.writeFile` is a convenience method that
performs multiple `write` calls internally to write the buffer passed to it.
For performance sensitive code consider using `fs.createWriteStream()`.

It is possible to use an {AbortSignal} to cancel an `fs.writeFile()`.
Cancelation is "best effort", and some amount of data is likely still
to be written.

```mjs
import { writeFile } from 'node:fs';
import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';

const controller = new AbortController();
const { signal } = controller;
const data = new Uint8Array(Buffer.from('Hello Node.js'));
writeFile('message.txt', data, { signal }, (err) => {
  // When a request is aborted - the callback is called with an AbortError
});
// When the request should be aborted
controller.abort();
```

Aborting an ongoing request does not abort individual operating
system requests but rather the internal buffering `fs.writeFile` performs.

#### Using `fs.writeFile()` with file descriptors

When `file` is a file descriptor, the behavior is almost identical to directly
calling `fs.write()` like:

```mjs
import { write } from 'node:fs';
import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';

write(fd, Buffer.from(data, options.encoding), callback);
```

The difference from directly calling `fs.write()` is that under some unusual
conditions, `fs.write()` might write only part of the buffer and need to be
retried to write the remaining data, whereas `fs.writeFile()` retries until
the data is entirely written (or an error occurs).

The implications of this are a common source of confusion. In
the file descriptor case, the file is not replaced! The data is not necessarily
written to the beginning of the file, and the file's original data may remain
before and/or after the newly written data.

For example, if `fs.writeFile()` is called twice in a row, first to write the
string `'Hello'`, then to write the string `', World'`, the file would contain
`'Hello, World'`, and might contain some of the file's original data (depending
on the size of the original file, and the position of the file descriptor). If
a file name had been used instead of a descriptor, the file would be guaranteed
to contain only `', World'`.

### `fs.writev(fd, buffers[, position], callback)`

* `fd` {integer}
* `buffers` {ArrayBufferView\[]}
* `position` {integer|null} **Default:** `null`
* `callback` {Function}
  * `err` {Error}
  * `bytesWritten` {integer}
  * `buffers` {ArrayBufferView\[]}

Write an array of `ArrayBufferView`s to the file specified by `fd` using
`writev()`.

`position` is the offset from the beginning of the file where this data
should be written. If `typeof position !== 'number'`, the data will be written
at the current position.

The callback will be given three arguments: `err`, `bytesWritten`, and
`buffers`. `bytesWritten` is how many bytes were written from `buffers`.

If this method is `util.promisify()`ed, it returns a promise for an
`Object` with `bytesWritten` and `buffers` properties.

It is unsafe to use `fs.writev()` multiple times on the same file without
waiting for the callback. For this scenario, use `fs.createWriteStream()`.

On Linux, positional writes don't work when the file is opened in append mode.
The kernel ignores the position argument and always appends the data to
the end of the file.
