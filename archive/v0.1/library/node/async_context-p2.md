# Asynchronous context tracking (part 2 of 2)

## Class: `AsyncResource`

The class `AsyncResource` is designed to be extended by the embedder's async
resources. Using this, users can easily trigger the lifetime events of their
own resources.

The `init` hook will trigger when an `AsyncResource` is instantiated.

The following is an overview of the `AsyncResource` API.

```mjs
import { AsyncResource, executionAsyncId } from 'node:async_hooks';

// AsyncResource() is meant to be extended. Instantiating a
// new AsyncResource() also triggers init. If triggerAsyncId is omitted then
// async_hook.executionAsyncId() is used.
const asyncResource = new AsyncResource(
  type, { triggerAsyncId: executionAsyncId(), requireManualDestroy: false },
);

// Run a function in the execution context of the resource. This will
// * establish the context of the resource
// * trigger the AsyncHooks before callbacks
// * call the provided function `fn` with the supplied arguments
// * trigger the AsyncHooks after callbacks
// * restore the original execution context
asyncResource.runInAsyncScope(fn, thisArg, ...args);

// Call AsyncHooks destroy callbacks.
asyncResource.emitDestroy();

// Return the unique ID assigned to the AsyncResource instance.
asyncResource.asyncId();

// Return the trigger ID for the AsyncResource instance.
asyncResource.triggerAsyncId();
```

```cjs
const { AsyncResource, executionAsyncId } = require('node:async_hooks');

// AsyncResource() is meant to be extended. Instantiating a
// new AsyncResource() also triggers init. If triggerAsyncId is omitted then
// async_hook.executionAsyncId() is used.
const asyncResource = new AsyncResource(
  type, { triggerAsyncId: executionAsyncId(), requireManualDestroy: false },
);

// Run a function in the execution context of the resource. This will
// * establish the context of the resource
// * trigger the AsyncHooks before callbacks
// * call the provided function `fn` with the supplied arguments
// * trigger the AsyncHooks after callbacks
// * restore the original execution context
asyncResource.runInAsyncScope(fn, thisArg, ...args);

// Call AsyncHooks destroy callbacks.
asyncResource.emitDestroy();

// Return the unique ID assigned to the AsyncResource instance.
asyncResource.asyncId();

// Return the trigger ID for the AsyncResource instance.
asyncResource.triggerAsyncId();
```

### `new AsyncResource(type[, options])`

* `type` {string} The type of async event.
* `options` {Object}
  * `triggerAsyncId` {number} The ID of the execution context that created this
    async event. **Default:** `executionAsyncId()`.
  * `requireManualDestroy` {boolean} If set to `true`, disables `emitDestroy`
    when the object is garbage collected. This usually does not need to be set
    (even if `emitDestroy` is called manually), unless the resource's `asyncId`
    is retrieved and the sensitive API's `emitDestroy` is called with it.
    When set to `false`, the `emitDestroy` call on garbage collection
    will only take place if there is at least one active `destroy` hook.
    **Default:** `false`.

Example usage:

```js
class DBQuery extends AsyncResource {
  constructor(db) {
    super('DBQuery');
    this.db = db;
  }

  getInfo(query, callback) {
    this.db.get(query, (err, data) => {
      this.runInAsyncScope(callback, null, err, data);
    });
  }

  close() {
    this.db = null;
    this.emitDestroy();
  }
}
```

### Static method: `AsyncResource.bind(fn[, type[, thisArg]])`

* `fn` {Function} The function to bind to the current execution context.
* `type` {string} An optional name to associate with the underlying
  `AsyncResource`.
* `thisArg` {any}

Binds the given function to the current execution context.

### `asyncResource.bind(fn[, thisArg])`

* `fn` {Function} The function to bind to the current `AsyncResource`.
* `thisArg` {any}

Binds the given function to execute to this `AsyncResource`'s scope.

### `asyncResource.runInAsyncScope(fn[, thisArg, ...args])`

* `fn` {Function} The function to call in the execution context of this async
  resource.
* `thisArg` {any} The receiver to be used for the function call.
* `...args` {any} Optional arguments to pass to the function.

Call the provided function with the provided arguments in the execution context
of the async resource. This will establish the context, trigger the AsyncHooks
before callbacks, call the function, trigger the AsyncHooks after callbacks, and
then restore the original execution context.

### `asyncResource.emitDestroy()`

* Returns: {AsyncResource} A reference to `asyncResource`.

Call all `destroy` hooks. This should only ever be called once. An error will
be thrown if it is called more than once. This **must** be manually called. If
the resource is left to be collected by the GC then the `destroy` hooks will
never be called.

### `asyncResource.asyncId()`

* Returns: {number} The unique `asyncId` assigned to the resource.

### `asyncResource.triggerAsyncId()`

* Returns: {number} The same `triggerAsyncId` that is passed to the
  `AsyncResource` constructor.

### Using `AsyncResource` for a `Worker` thread pool

The following example shows how to use the `AsyncResource` class to properly
provide async tracking for a `Worker` pool. Other resource pools, such as
database connection pools, can follow a similar model.

Assuming that the task is adding two numbers, using a file named
`task_processor.js` with the following content:

```mjs
import { parentPort } from 'node:worker_threads';
parentPort.on('message', (task) => {
  parentPort.postMessage(task.a + task.b);
});
```

```cjs
const { parentPort } = require('node:worker_threads');
parentPort.on('message', (task) => {
  parentPort.postMessage(task.a + task.b);
});
```

a Worker pool around it could use the following structure:

```mjs
import { AsyncResource } from 'node:async_hooks';
import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
import { Worker } from 'node:worker_threads';

const kTaskInfo = Symbol('kTaskInfo');
const kWorkerFreedEvent = Symbol('kWorkerFreedEvent');

class WorkerPoolTaskInfo extends AsyncResource {
  constructor(callback) {
    super('WorkerPoolTaskInfo');
    this.callback = callback;
  }

  done(err, result) {
    this.runInAsyncScope(this.callback, null, err, result);
    this.emitDestroy();  // `TaskInfo`s are used only once.
  }
}

export default class WorkerPool extends EventEmitter {
  constructor(numThreads) {
    super();
    this.numThreads = numThreads;
    this.workers = [];
    this.freeWorkers = [];
    this.tasks = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < numThreads; i++)
      this.addNewWorker();

    // Any time the kWorkerFreedEvent is emitted, dispatch
    // the next task pending in the queue, if any.
    this.on(kWorkerFreedEvent, () => {
      if (this.tasks.length > 0) {
        const { task, callback } = this.tasks.shift();
        this.runTask(task, callback);
      }
    });
  }

  addNewWorker() {
    const worker = new Worker(new URL('task_processor.js', import.meta.url));
    worker.on('message', (result) => {
      // In case of success: Call the callback that was passed to `runTask`,
      // remove the `TaskInfo` associated with the Worker, and mark it as free
      // again.
      worker[kTaskInfo].done(null, result);
      worker[kTaskInfo] = null;
      this.freeWorkers.push(worker);
      this.emit(kWorkerFreedEvent);
    });
    worker.on('error', (err) => {
      // In case of an uncaught exception: Call the callback that was passed to
      // `runTask` with the error.
      if (worker[kTaskInfo])
        worker[kTaskInfo].done(err, null);
      else
        this.emit('error', err);
      // Remove the worker from the list and start a new Worker to replace the
      // current one.
      this.workers.splice(this.workers.indexOf(worker), 1);
      this.addNewWorker();
    });
    this.workers.push(worker);
    this.freeWorkers.push(worker);
    this.emit(kWorkerFreedEvent);
  }

  runTask(task, callback) {
    if (this.freeWorkers.length === 0) {
      // No free threads, wait until a worker thread becomes free.
      this.tasks.push({ task, callback });
      return;
    }

    const worker = this.freeWorkers.pop();
    worker[kTaskInfo] = new WorkerPoolTaskInfo(callback);
    worker.postMessage(task);
  }

  close() {
    for (const worker of this.workers) worker.terminate();
  }
}
```

```cjs
const { AsyncResource } = require('node:async_hooks');
const { EventEmitter } = require('node:events');
const path = require('node:path');
const { Worker } = require('node:worker_threads');

const kTaskInfo = Symbol('kTaskInfo');
const kWorkerFreedEvent = Symbol('kWorkerFreedEvent');

class WorkerPoolTaskInfo extends AsyncResource {
  constructor(callback) {
    super('WorkerPoolTaskInfo');
    this.callback = callback;
  }

  done(err, result) {
    this.runInAsyncScope(this.callback, null, err, result);
    this.emitDestroy();  // `TaskInfo`s are used only once.
  }
}

class WorkerPool extends EventEmitter {
  constructor(numThreads) {
    super();
    this.numThreads = numThreads;
    this.workers = [];
    this.freeWorkers = [];
    this.tasks = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < numThreads; i++)
      this.addNewWorker();

    // Any time the kWorkerFreedEvent is emitted, dispatch
    // the next task pending in the queue, if any.
    this.on(kWorkerFreedEvent, () => {
      if (this.tasks.length > 0) {
        const { task, callback } = this.tasks.shift();
        this.runTask(task, callback);
      }
    });
  }

  addNewWorker() {
    const worker = new Worker(path.resolve(__dirname, 'task_processor.js'));
    worker.on('message', (result) => {
      // In case of success: Call the callback that was passed to `runTask`,
      // remove the `TaskInfo` associated with the Worker, and mark it as free
      // again.
      worker[kTaskInfo].done(null, result);
      worker[kTaskInfo] = null;
      this.freeWorkers.push(worker);
      this.emit(kWorkerFreedEvent);
    });
    worker.on('error', (err) => {
      // In case of an uncaught exception: Call the callback that was passed to
      // `runTask` with the error.
      if (worker[kTaskInfo])
        worker[kTaskInfo].done(err, null);
      else
        this.emit('error', err);
      // Remove the worker from the list and start a new Worker to replace the
      // current one.
      this.workers.splice(this.workers.indexOf(worker), 1);
      this.addNewWorker();
    });
    this.workers.push(worker);
    this.freeWorkers.push(worker);
    this.emit(kWorkerFreedEvent);
  }

  runTask(task, callback) {
    if (this.freeWorkers.length === 0) {
      // No free threads, wait until a worker thread becomes free.
      this.tasks.push({ task, callback });
      return;
    }

    const worker = this.freeWorkers.pop();
    worker[kTaskInfo] = new WorkerPoolTaskInfo(callback);
    worker.postMessage(task);
  }

  close() {
    for (const worker of this.workers) worker.terminate();
  }
}

module.exports = WorkerPool;
```

Without the explicit tracking added by the `WorkerPoolTaskInfo` objects,
it would appear that the callbacks are associated with the individual `Worker`
objects. However, the creation of the `Worker`s is not associated with the
creation of the tasks and does not provide information about when tasks
were scheduled.

This pool could be used as follows:

```mjs
import WorkerPool from './worker_pool.js';
import os from 'node:os';

const pool = new WorkerPool(os.availableParallelism());

let finished = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  pool.runTask({ a: 42, b: 100 }, (err, result) => {
    console.log(i, err, result);
    if (++finished === 10)
      pool.close();
  });
}
```

```cjs
const WorkerPool = require('./worker_pool.js');
const os = require('node:os');

const pool = new WorkerPool(os.availableParallelism());

let finished = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  pool.runTask({ a: 42, b: 100 }, (err, result) => {
    console.log(i, err, result);
    if (++finished === 10)
      pool.close();
  });
}
```

### Integrating `AsyncResource` with `EventEmitter`

Event listeners triggered by an `EventEmitter` may be run in a different
execution context than the one that was active when `eventEmitter.on()` was
called.

The following example shows how to use the `AsyncResource` class to properly
associate an event listener with the correct execution context. The same
approach can be applied to a `Stream` or a similar event-driven class.

```mjs
import { createServer } from 'node:http';
import { AsyncResource, executionAsyncId } from 'node:async_hooks';

const server = createServer((req, res) => {
  req.on('close', AsyncResource.bind(() => {
    // Execution context is bound to the current outer scope.
  }));
  req.on('close', () => {
    // Execution context is bound to the scope that caused 'close' to emit.
  });
  res.end();
}).listen(3000);
```

```cjs
const { createServer } = require('node:http');
const { AsyncResource, executionAsyncId } = require('node:async_hooks');

const server = createServer((req, res) => {
  req.on('close', AsyncResource.bind(() => {
    // Execution context is bound to the current outer scope.
  }));
  req.on('close', () => {
    // Execution context is bound to the scope that caused 'close' to emit.
  });
  res.end();
}).listen(3000);
```
