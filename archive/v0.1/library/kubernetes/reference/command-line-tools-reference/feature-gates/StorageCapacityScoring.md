# StorageCapacityScoring

The feature gate `VolumeCapacityPriority` was used in v1.32 to support storage that are
statically provisioned. Starting from v1.33, the new feature gate `StorageCapacityScoring`
replaces the old `VolumeCapacityPriority` gate with added support to dynamically provisioned storage.
When `StorageCapacityScoring` is enabled, the VolumeBinding plugin in the kube-scheduler is extended
to score Nodes based on the storage capacity on each of them.
This feature is applicable to CSI volumes that supported Storage Capacity,
including local storage backed by a CSI driver.
