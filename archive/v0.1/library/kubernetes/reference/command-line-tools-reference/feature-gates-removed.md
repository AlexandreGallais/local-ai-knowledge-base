# Feature Gates (removed)

This page contains list of feature gates that have been removed. The information on this page is for reference.
A removed feature gate is different from a GA'ed or deprecated one in that a removed one is
no longer recognized as a valid feature gate.
However, a GA'ed or a deprecated feature gate is still recognized by the corresponding Kubernetes
components although they are unable to cause any behavior differences in a cluster.

For feature gates that are still recognized by the Kubernetes components, please refer to
the Alpha/Beta feature gate table
or the Graduated/Deprecated feature gate table

### Feature gates that are removed

In the following table:

- The "From" column contains the Kubernetes release when a feature is introduced
  or its release stage is changed.
- The "To" column, if not empty, contains the last Kubernetes release in which
  you can still use a feature gate. If the feature stage is either "Deprecated"
  or "GA", the "To" column is the Kubernetes release when the feature is removed.
