# What's New in EF Core 8 (part 7 of 11)

### Querying hierarchies

`HierarchyId` exposes several methods that can be used in LINQ queries.

| Method                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GetAncestor(int n)`                                             | Gets the node `n` levels up the hierarchical tree.                                                                                                                         |
| `GetDescendant(HierarchyId? child1, HierarchyId? child2)`        | Gets the value of a descendant node that is greater than `child1` and less than `child2`.                                                                                  |
| `GetLevel()`                                                     | Gets the level of this node in the hierarchical tree.                                                                                                                      |
| `GetReparentedValue(HierarchyId? oldRoot, HierarchyId? newRoot)` | Gets a value representing the location of a new node that has a path from `newRoot` equal to the path from `oldRoot` to this, effectively moving this to the new location. |
| `IsDescendantOf(HierarchyId? parent)`                            | Gets a value indicating whether this node is a descendant of `parent`.                                                                                                     |

In addition, the operators `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` can be used.

The following are examples of using these methods in LINQ queries.

**Get entities at a given level in the tree**

The following query uses `GetLevel` to return all halflings at a given level in the family tree:

```csharp
var generation = await context.Halflings.Where(halfling => halfling.PathFromPatriarch.GetLevel() == level).ToListAsync();
```

This translates to the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT [h].[Id], [h].[Name], [h].[PathFromPatriarch], [h].[YearOfBirth]
FROM [Halflings] AS [h]
WHERE [h].[PathFromPatriarch].GetLevel() = @__level_0
```

Running this in a loop we can get the halflings for every generation:

```text
Generation 0: Balbo
Generation 1: Mungo, Pansy, Ponto, Largo, Lily
Generation 2: Bungo, Belba, Longo, Linda, Bingo, Rosa, Polo, Fosco
Generation 3: Bilbo, Otho, Falco, Posco, Prisca, Dora, Drogo, Dudo
Generation 4: Lotho, Poppy, Ponto, Porto, Peony, Frodo, Daisy
Generation 5: Angelica
```

**Get the direct ancestor of an entity**

The following query uses `GetAncestor` to find the direct ancestor of a halfling, given that halfling's name:

```csharp
async Task<Halfling?> FindDirectAncestor(string name)
    => await context.Halflings
        .SingleOrDefaultAsync(
            ancestor => ancestor.PathFromPatriarch == context.Halflings
                .Single(descendent => descendent.Name == name).PathFromPatriarch
                .GetAncestor(1));
```

This translates to the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT TOP(2) [h].[Id], [h].[Name], [h].[PathFromPatriarch], [h].[YearOfBirth]
FROM [Halflings] AS [h]
WHERE [h].[PathFromPatriarch] = (
    SELECT TOP(1) [h0].[PathFromPatriarch]
    FROM [Halflings] AS [h0]
    WHERE [h0].[Name] = @__name_0).GetAncestor(1)
```

Running this query for the halfling "Bilbo" returns "Bungo".

**Get the direct descendents of an entity**

The following query also uses `GetAncestor`, but this time to find the direct descendents of a halfling, given that halfling's name:

```csharp
IQueryable<Halfling> FindDirectDescendents(string name)
    => context.Halflings.Where(
        descendent => descendent.PathFromPatriarch.GetAncestor(1) == context.Halflings
            .Single(ancestor => ancestor.Name == name).PathFromPatriarch);
```

This translates to the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT [h].[Id], [h].[Name], [h].[PathFromPatriarch], [h].[YearOfBirth]
FROM [Halflings] AS [h]
WHERE [h].[PathFromPatriarch].GetAncestor(1) = (
    SELECT TOP(1) [h0].[PathFromPatriarch]
    FROM [Halflings] AS [h0]
    WHERE [h0].[Name] = @__name_0)
```

Running this query for the halfling "Mungo" returns "Bungo", "Belba", "Longo", and "Linda".

**Get all ancestors of an entity**

`GetAncestor` is useful for searching up or down a single level, or, indeed, a specified number of levels. On the other hand, `IsDescendantOf` is useful for finding all ancestors or dependents. For example, the following query uses `IsDescendantOf` to find the all the ancestors of a halfling, given that halfling's name:

```csharp
IQueryable<Halfling> FindAllAncestors(string name)
    => context.Halflings.Where(
            ancestor => context.Halflings
                .Single(
                    descendent =>
                        descendent.Name == name
                        && ancestor.Id != descendent.Id)
                .PathFromPatriarch.IsDescendantOf(ancestor.PathFromPatriarch))
        .OrderByDescending(ancestor => ancestor.PathFromPatriarch.GetLevel());
```

> **Important:**
> `IsDescendantOf` returns true for itself, which is why it is filtered out in the query above.

This translates to the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT [h].[Id], [h].[Name], [h].[PathFromPatriarch], [h].[YearOfBirth]
FROM [Halflings] AS [h]
WHERE (
    SELECT TOP(1) [h0].[PathFromPatriarch]
    FROM [Halflings] AS [h0]
    WHERE [h0].[Name] = @__name_0 AND [h].[Id] <> [h0].[Id]).IsDescendantOf([h].[PathFromPatriarch]) = CAST(1 AS bit)
ORDER BY [h].[PathFromPatriarch].GetLevel() DESC
```

Running this query for the halfling "Bilbo" returns "Bungo", "Mungo", and "Balbo".

**Get all descendents of an entity**

The following query also uses `IsDescendantOf`, but this time to all the descendents of a halfling, given that halfling's name:

```csharp
IQueryable<Halfling> FindAllDescendents(string name)
    => context.Halflings.Where(
            descendent => descendent.PathFromPatriarch.IsDescendantOf(
                context.Halflings
                    .Single(
                        ancestor =>
                            ancestor.Name == name
                            && descendent.Id != ancestor.Id)
                    .PathFromPatriarch))
        .OrderBy(descendent => descendent.PathFromPatriarch.GetLevel());
```

This translates to the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT [h].[Id], [h].[Name], [h].[PathFromPatriarch], [h].[YearOfBirth]
FROM [Halflings] AS [h]
WHERE [h].[PathFromPatriarch].IsDescendantOf((
    SELECT TOP(1) [h0].[PathFromPatriarch]
    FROM [Halflings] AS [h0]
    WHERE [h0].[Name] = @__name_0 AND [h].[Id] <> [h0].[Id])) = CAST(1 AS bit)
ORDER BY [h].[PathFromPatriarch].GetLevel()
```

Running this query for the halfling "Mungo" returns "Bungo", "Belba", "Longo", "Linda", "Bingo", "Bilbo", "Otho", "Falco", "Lotho", and "Poppy".

**Finding a common ancestor**

One of the most common questions asked about this particular family tree is, "who is the common ancestor of Frodo and Bilbo?" We can use `IsDescendantOf` to write such a query:

```csharp
async Task<Halfling?> FindCommonAncestor(Halfling first, Halfling second)
    => await context.Halflings
        .Where(
            ancestor => first.PathFromPatriarch.IsDescendantOf(ancestor.PathFromPatriarch)
                        && second.PathFromPatriarch.IsDescendantOf(ancestor.PathFromPatriarch))
        .OrderByDescending(ancestor => ancestor.PathFromPatriarch.GetLevel())
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync();
```

This translates to the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT TOP(1) [h].[Id], [h].[Name], [h].[PathFromPatriarch], [h].[YearOfBirth]
FROM [Halflings] AS [h]
WHERE @__first_PathFromPatriarch_0.IsDescendantOf([h].[PathFromPatriarch]) = CAST(1 AS bit)
  AND @__second_PathFromPatriarch_1.IsDescendantOf([h].[PathFromPatriarch]) = CAST(1 AS bit)
ORDER BY [h].[PathFromPatriarch].GetLevel() DESC
```

Running this query with "Bilbo" and "Frodo" tells us that their common ancestor is "Balbo".

### Updating hierarchies

The normal change tracking and SaveChanges mechanisms can be used to update `hierarchyid` columns.

**Re-parenting a sub-hierarchy**

For example, I'm sure we all remember the scandal of SR 1752 (a.k.a. "LongoGate") when DNA testing revealed that Longo was not in fact the son of Mungo, but actually the son of Ponto! One fallout from this scandal was that the family tree needed to be re-written. In particular, Longo and all his descendents needed to be re-parented from Mungo to Ponto. `GetReparentedValue` can be used to do this. For example, first "Longo" and all his descendents are queried:

```csharp
var longoAndDescendents = await context.Halflings.Where(
        descendent => descendent.PathFromPatriarch.IsDescendantOf(
            context.Halflings.Single(ancestor => ancestor.Name == "Longo").PathFromPatriarch))
    .ToListAsync();
```

Then `GetReparentedValue` is used to update the `HierarchyId` for Longo and each descendent, followed by a call to `SaveChangesAsync`:

```csharp
foreach (var descendent in longoAndDescendents)
{
    descendent.PathFromPatriarch
        = descendent.PathFromPatriarch.GetReparentedValue(
            mungo.PathFromPatriarch, ponto.PathFromPatriarch)!;
}

await context.SaveChangesAsync();
```

This results in the following database update:

```sql
SET NOCOUNT ON;
UPDATE [Halflings] SET [PathFromPatriarch] = @p0
OUTPUT 1
WHERE [Id] = @p1;
UPDATE [Halflings] SET [PathFromPatriarch] = @p2
OUTPUT 1
WHERE [Id] = @p3;
UPDATE [Halflings] SET [PathFromPatriarch] = @p4
OUTPUT 1
WHERE [Id] = @p5;
```

Using these parameters:

```text
 @p1='9',
 @p0='0x7BC0' (Nullable = false) (Size = 2) (DbType = Object),
 @p3='16',
 @p2='0x7BD6' (Nullable = false) (Size = 2) (DbType = Object),
 @p5='23',
 @p4='0x7BD6B0' (Nullable = false) (Size = 3) (DbType = Object)
 ```

> **Note:**
> The parameters values for `HierarchyId` properties are sent to the database in their compact, binary format.

Following the update, querying for the descendents of "Mungo" returns "Bungo", "Belba", "Linda", "Bingo", "Bilbo", "Falco", and "Poppy", while querying for the descendents of "Ponto" returns "Longo", "Rosa", "Polo", "Otho", "Posco", "Prisca", "Lotho", "Ponto", "Porto", "Peony", and "Angelica".
