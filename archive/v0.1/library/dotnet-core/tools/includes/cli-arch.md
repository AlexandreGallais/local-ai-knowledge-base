# cli-arch

**`-a|--arch <ARCHITECTURE>`**

Specifies the target architecture. This is a shorthand syntax for setting the Runtime Identifier (RID), where the provided value is combined with the default RID. For example, on a `win-x64` machine, specifying `--arch x86` sets the RID to `win-x86`. If you use this option, don't use the `-r|--runtime` option. Available since .NET 6 Preview 7.
