# podman create --userns=auto:size=65536 ubi8-init (part 2 of 11)

## OPTIONS

<< if is_quadlet >>
### `AddHost=hostname[;hostname[;...]]:ip`
<< else >>
#### **--add-host**=*hostname[;hostname[;...]]*:*ip*
<< endif >>

Add a custom host-to-IP mapping to the <<container|pod>>'s `/etc/hosts` file.

The option takes one or multiple semicolon-separated hostnames to be mapped to
a single IPv4 or IPv6 address, separated by a colon. It can also be used to
overwrite the IP addresses of hostnames Podman adds to `/etc/hosts` by default
(also see the **--name** and **--hostname** options). This option can be
specified multiple times to add additional mappings to `/etc/hosts`. It
conflicts with the **--no-hosts** option and conflicts with *no_hosts=true* in
`containers.conf`.

Instead of an IP address, the special flag *host-gateway* can be given. This
resolves to an IP address the container can use to connect to the host. The
IP address chosen depends on your network setup, thus there's no guarantee that
Podman can determine the *host-gateway* address automatically, which will then
cause Podman to fail with an error message. You can overwrite this IP address
using the *host_containers_internal_ip* option in *containers.conf*.

The *host-gateway* address is also used by Podman to automatically add the
`host.containers.internal` and `host.docker.internal` hostnames to `/etc/hosts`.
You can prevent that by either giving the **--no-hosts** option, or by setting
*host_containers_internal_ip="none"* in *containers.conf*. If no *host-gateway*
address was configured manually and Podman fails to determine the IP address
automatically, Podman will silently skip adding these internal hostnames to
`/etc/hosts`. If Podman is running in a virtual machine using `podman machine`
(this includes Mac and Windows hosts), Podman will silently skip adding the
internal hostnames to `/etc/hosts`, unless an IP address was configured
manually; the internal hostnames are resolved by the gvproxy DNS resolver
instead.

Podman will use the `/etc/hosts` file of the host as a basis by default, i.e.
any hostname present in this file will also be present in the `/etc/hosts` file
of the container. A different base file can be configured using the
*base_hosts_file* config in `containers.conf`.

<< if is_quadlet >>
### `Arch=ARCH`
<< else >>
#### **--arch**=*ARCH*
<< endif >>

Override the architecture, defaults to the host, of the image to be pulled. For example, `arm`.
Unless overridden, subsequent lookups of the same image in the local storage matches this architecture, regardless of the host.

#### **--attach**, **-a**=*stdin* | *stdout* | *stderr*

Attach to STDIN, STDOUT or STDERR.

In foreground mode (the default when **-d**
is not specified), **podman run** can start the process in the container
and attach the console to the process's standard input, output, and
error. It can even pretend to be a TTY (this is what most command-line
executables expect) and pass along signals. The **-a** option can be set for
each of **stdin**, **stdout**, and **stderr**.

<< if is_quadlet >>
### `AuthFile=path`
<< else >>
#### **--authfile**=*path*
<< endif >>

Path of the authentication file. Default is `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json` on Linux, and `$HOME/.config/containers/auth.json` on Windows/macOS.
The file is created by **podman login**. If the authorization state is not found there, `$HOME/.docker/config.json` is checked, which is set using **docker login**.

Note: There is also the option to override the default path of the authentication file by setting the `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` environment variable. This can be done with **export REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE=_path_**.

#### **--blkio-weight**=*weight*

Block IO relative weight. The _weight_ is a value between **10** and **1000**.

This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

#### **--blkio-weight-device**=*device:weight*

Block IO relative device weight.

<< if is_quadlet >>
### `AddCapability=capability`
<< else >>
#### **--cap-add**=*capability*
<< endif >>

Add Linux capabilities.

Granting additional capabilities increases the privileges of the
processes running inside the container and potentially allow it to
break out of confinement.  Capabilities like `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`,
`CAP_SYS_PTRACE`, `CAP_MKNOD` and `CAP_SYS_MODULE` are particularly
dangerous when they are not used within a user namespace.  Please
refer to **user_namespaces(7)** for a more detailed explanation of the
interaction between user namespaces and capabilities.

Before adding any capability, review its security implications and
ensure it is really necessary for the container’s functionality.  See
**capabilities(7)** for more information.

<< if is_quadlet >>
### `DropCapability=capability`
<< else >>
#### **--cap-drop**=*capability*
<< endif >>

Drop these capabilities from the default podman capability set, or `all` to drop all capabilities.

This is a space separated list of capabilities.

<< if is_quadlet >>
### `CertDir=path`
<< else >>
#### **--cert-dir**=*path*
<< endif >>

Use certificates at *path* (\*.crt, \*.cert, \*.key) to connect to the registry. (Default: /etc/containers/certs.d)
For details, see **containers-certs.d(5)**.
(This option is not available with the remote Podman client, including Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines)

#### **--cgroup-conf**=*KEY=VALUE*

When running on cgroup v2, specify the cgroup file to write to and its value. For example **--cgroup-conf=memory.high=1073741824** sets the memory.high limit to 1GB.

#### **--cgroup-parent**=*path*

Path to cgroups under which the cgroup for the <<container|pod>> is created. If the
path is not absolute, the path is considered to be relative to the cgroups path
of the init process. Cgroups are created if they do not already exist.

#### **--cgroupns**=*mode*

Set the cgroup namespace mode for the container.

- **host**: use the host's cgroup namespace inside the container.
- **container:**_id_: join the namespace of the specified container.
- **private**: create a new cgroup namespace.
- **ns:**_path_: join the namespace at the specified path.

If the host uses cgroups v1, the default is set to **host**. On cgroups v2, the default is **private**.

<< if is_quadlet >>
### `CgroupsMode=how`
<< else >>
#### **--cgroups**=*how*
<< endif >>

Determines whether the container creates cgroups.

<< if is_quadlet >>
By default, the cgroups mode of the container created by Quadlet is `split`,
which differs from the default (`enabled`) used by the Podman CLI.

If the container joins a pod (i.e. `Pod=` is specified), you may want to change this to
`no-conmon` or `enabled` so that pod level cgroup resource limits can take effect.
<< else >>
Default is **enabled**.
<< endif >>

The **enabled** option creates a new cgroup under the cgroup-parent.
The **disabled** option forces the container to not create cgroups, and thus conflicts with cgroup options (**--cgroupns** and **--cgroup-parent**).
The **no-conmon** option disables a new cgroup only for the **conmon** process.
The **split** option splits the current cgroup in two sub-cgroups: one for conmon and one for the container payload. It is not possible to set **--cgroup-parent** with **split**.

#### **--chrootdirs**=*path*

Path to a directory inside the container that is treated as a `chroot` directory.
Any Podman managed file (e.g., /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/hosts, /etc/hostname) that is mounted into the root directory is mounted into that location as well.
Multiple directories are separated with a comma.

#### **--conmon-pidfile**=*file*

Write the pid of the **conmon** process to a file. As **conmon** runs in a separate process than Podman, this is necessary when using systemd to restart Podman containers.
(This option is not available with the remote Podman client, including Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines)

#### **--cpu-period**=*limit*

Set the CPU period for the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS), which is a
duration in microseconds. Once the container's CPU quota is used up, it will not
be scheduled to run until the current period ends. Defaults to 100000
microseconds.

On some systems, changing the resource limits may not be allowed for non-root
users. For more details, see
https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

#### **--cpu-quota**=*limit*

Limit the CPU Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) quota.

Limit the container's CPU usage. By default, containers run with the full
CPU resource. The limit is a number in microseconds. If a number is provided,
the container is allowed to use that much CPU time until the CPU period
ends (controllable via **--cpu-period**).

On some systems, changing the resource limits may not be allowed for non-root
users. For more details, see
https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

#### **--cpu-shares**, **-c**=*shares*

CPU shares (relative weight).

By default, all containers get the same proportion of CPU cycles. This
proportion can be modified by changing the container's CPU share weighting
relative to the combined weight of all the running containers.
Default weight is **1024**.

The proportion only applies when CPU-intensive processes are running.
When tasks in one container are idle, other containers can use the
left-over CPU time. The actual amount of CPU time varies depending on
the number of containers running on the system.

For example, consider three containers, one has a cpu-share of 1024 and
two others have a cpu-share setting of 512. When processes in all three
containers attempt to use 100% of CPU, the first container receives
50% of the total CPU time. If a fourth container is added with a cpu-share
of 1024, the first container only gets 33% of the CPU. The remaining containers
receive 16.5%, 16.5% and 33% of the CPU.

On a multi-core system, the shares of CPU time are distributed over all CPU
cores. Even if a container is limited to less than 100% of CPU time, it can
use 100% of each individual CPU core.

For example, consider a system with more than three cores.
If the container _C0_ is started with **--cpu-shares=512** running one process,
and another container _C1_ with **--cpu-shares=1024** running two processes,
this can result in the following division of CPU shares:

| PID  |  container  | CPU     | CPU share    |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- | ------------ |
| 100  |  C0         | 0       | 100% of CPU0 |
| 101  |  C1         | 1       | 100% of CPU1 |
| 102  |  C1         | 2       | 100% of CPU2 |

On some systems, changing the resource limits may not be allowed for non-root
users. For more details, see
https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

#### **--cpuset-cpus**=*number*

CPUs in which to allow execution. Can be specified as a comma-separated list
(e.g. **0,1**), as a range (e.g. **0-3**), or any combination thereof
(e.g. **0-3,7,11-15**).

On some systems, changing the resource limits may not be allowed for non-root
users. For more details, see
https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

#### **--cpuset-mems**=*nodes*

Memory nodes (MEMs) in which to allow execution (0-3, 0,1). Only effective on
NUMA systems.

If there are four memory nodes on the system (0-3), use **--cpuset-mems=0,1**
then processes in the container only uses memory from the first
two memory nodes.

On some systems, changing the resource limits may not be allowed for non-root
users. For more details, see
https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

<< if is_quadlet >>
### `Creds=[username[:password]]`
<< else >>
#### **--creds**=*[username[:password]]*
<< endif >>

The [username[:password]] to use to authenticate with the registry, if required.
If one or both values are not supplied, a command line prompt appears and the
value can be entered. The password is entered without echo.

Note that the specified credentials are only used to authenticate against
target registries.  They are not used for mirrors or when the registry gets
rewritten (see `containers-registries.conf(5)`); to authenticate against those
consider using a `containers-auth.json(5)` file.

<< if is_quadlet >>
### `DecryptionKey=key[:passphrase]`
<< else >>
#### **--decryption-key**=*key[:passphrase]*
<< endif >>

The [key[:passphrase]] to be used for decryption of images. Key can point to keys and/or certificates. Decryption is tried with all keys. If the key is protected by a passphrase, it is required to be passed in the argument and omitted otherwise.
