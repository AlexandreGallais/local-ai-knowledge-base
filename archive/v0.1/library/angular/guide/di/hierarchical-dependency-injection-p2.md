# Hierarchical injectors (part 2 of 5)

## Logical structure of the template

When you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the `ElementInjector` tree relative to where and how you provide those services.

Understanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.

Components are used in your templates, as in the following example:

```html
<app-root> <app-child />; </app-root>
```

HELPFUL: Usually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files.
For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree.
The term _logical_ distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree.
To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the `<#VIEW>` pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.

The following is an example of how the `<app-root>` and `<app-child>` view trees are combined into a single logical tree:

```html
<app-root>
  <#VIEW>
    <app-child>
     <#VIEW>
       …content goes here…
     </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>
```

Understanding the idea of the `<#VIEW>` demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.
