# Hardware intrinsic IsSupported checks may differ for nested types

Checking `<Isa>.X64.IsSupported`, where `<Isa>` refers to the classes in the `System.Runtime.Intrinsics.X86` namespace, may now produce a different result to previous versions of .NET.

> **Tip:**
> *ISA* stands for Instruction Set Architecture.

## Version introduced

5.0

## Change description

In previous versions of .NET, some of the `System.Runtime.Intrinsics.X86` hardware-intrinsic types, for example, `System.Runtime.Intrinsics.X86.Aes`, didn't expose a nested `X64` class. For these types, calling `<Isa>.X64.IsSupported` resolved to an `IsSupported` property on a nested `X64` class of a parent class of `<Isa>`. This meant that the property could return `true` even when `<Isa>.IsSupported` returns `false`.

In .NET 5 and later versions, all of the `System.Runtime.Intrinsics.X86` types expose a nested `X64` class that appropriately reports support. This ensures that the general hierarchy remains correct, and that if `<Isa>.X64.IsSupported` is `true`, then `<Isa>.IsSupported` can also be assumed to be `true`.

## Reason for change

It was intended that if `<Isa>.X64.IsSupported` is `true`, `<Isa>.IsSupported` is also implied to be `true`. However, due to how member resolution works in C#, classes that didn't have a nested `X64` class exposed a situation where this wasn't always the case and led to bugs in user code.

## Recommended action

If necessary, adjust code that checks `IsSupported` to check for the appropriate ISA.
