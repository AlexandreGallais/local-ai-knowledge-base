# NAME (part 2 of 3)

### `Network=mode`
<< else >>
#### **--network**=*mode*, **--net**
<< endif >>

Set the network mode for the <<container|pod>>.

<< if is_quadlet >>
Special cases:

* If the `name` of the network ends with `.network`, a Podman network called
`systemd-$name` is used, and the generated systemd service contains
a dependency on the `$name-network.service`. Such a network can be automatically
created by using a `$name.network` Quadlet file. Note: the corresponding `.network` file must exist.

* If the `name` ends with `.container`,
the container will reuse the network stack of another container created by `$name.container`.
The generated systemd service contains a dependency on `$name.service`. Note: the corresponding `.container` file must exist.
<< endif >>

Valid _mode_ values are:

- **bridge[:OPTIONS,...]**: Create a network stack on the default bridge. This is the default for rootful containers. It is possible to specify these additional options:
    - **alias=**_name_: Add network-scoped alias for the container.
    - **ip=**_IPv4_: Specify a static IPv4 address for this container.
    - **ip6=**_IPv6_: Specify a static IPv6 address for this container.
    - **mac=**_MAC_: Specify a static MAC address for this container.
    - **interface_name=**_name_: Specify a name for the created network interface inside the container.
    - **host_interface_name=**_name_: Specify a name for the created network interface outside the container.

    Any other options will be passed through to netavark without validation. This can be useful to pass arguments to netavark plugins.

    For rootless bridge networks, port forwarding uses `rootlessport` by default. Setting `rootless_port_forwarder="pasta"` in the `[network]` section of **containers.conf(5)** switches to pasta's kernel-level forwarding (via `pesto`), which preserves the original client source IP address inside the container. This option is experimental and its behavior is subject to change.

    For example, to set a static IPv4 address and a static mac address, use `--network bridge:ip=10.88.0.10,mac=44:33:22:11:00:99`.

- _\<network name or ID\>_**[:OPTIONS,...]**: Connect to a user-defined network; this is the network name or ID from a network created by **podman network create**. It is possible to specify the same options described under the bridge mode above. Use the **--network** option multiple times to specify additional networks. \
  For backwards compatibility it is also possible to specify comma-separated networks on the first **--network** argument, however this prevents you from using the options described under the bridge section above.

- **none**: Create a network namespace for the container but do not configure network interfaces for it, thus the container has no network connectivity.

- **container:**_id_: Reuse another container's network stack.

- **host**: Use the host's network namespace for the container instead of creating an isolated namespace. Warning: This gives the container full access to abstract Unix domain sockets and to TCP/UDP sockets bound to localhost. Since these mechanisms are often used to prevent access to sensitive system services, isolating them from access by external entities, use of this option may be considered a security vulnerability.

- **ns:**_path_: Path to a network namespace to join.

- **private**: Create a new namespace for the container. This uses the **bridge** mode for rootful containers and **pasta** for rootless ones.

- **pasta[:OPTIONS,...]**: use **pasta**(1) to create a user-mode networking
    stack. \
    This is the default for rootless containers and only supported in rootless mode. \
    By default, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and routes, as well as the pod interface
    name, are copied from the host. Port forwarding preserves the original
    source IP address. Options described in pasta(1) can be specified as
    comma-separated arguments. \
    In terms of pasta(1) options, **--config-net** is given by default, in
    order to configure networking when the container is started, and
    **--no-map-gw** is also assumed by default, to avoid direct access from
    container to host using the gateway address. The latter can be overridden
    by passing **--map-gw** in the pasta-specific options (despite not being an
    actual pasta(1) option). \
    For better integration with DNS handling, **--dns-forward 169.254.1.1** is passed by default,
    and this address is added to resolv.conf(5) as first resolver. It is possible to pass
    **--dns-forward** explicitly in case a different IP address should be used. \
    To make the `host.containers.internal` /etc/hosts entry work and allow connections
    to the host, **--map-guest-addr 169.254.1.2** is passed by default. Again, it can be set
    explicitly to choose a different IP address. \
    Also, **-t none** and **-u none** are passed if, respectively, no TCP or
    UDP port forwarding from host to container is configured (via Podman's
    **--publish** or by passing the pasta **-t**/**-u** options directly),
    to disable automatic port forwarding based on bound ports. Similarly, **-T none**
    and **-U none** are given to disable the same functionality from container to
    host. \
    All options can also be set in **containers.conf(5)**;
    see the `pasta_options` key under the network section in that file. \
    Some examples:
    - **pasta:--map-gw**: Allow the container to directly reach the host using the
        gateway address.
    - **pasta:--mtu,1500**: Specify a 1500 bytes MTU for the _tap_ interface in
        the container.
    - **pasta:--ipv4-only,-a,10.0.2.0,-n,24,-g,10.0.2.2,--dns-forward,10.0.2.3,-m,1500,--no-ndp,--no-dhcpv6,--no-dhcp**:
        disable IPv6, assign `10.0.2.0/24` to the `tap0` interface in the container,
        with gateway `10.0.2.3`, enable DNS forwarder reachable at `10.0.2.3`,
        set MTU to 1500 bytes, disable NDP, DHCPv6 and DHCP support.
    - **pasta:-I,tap0,--ipv4-only,-a,10.0.2.0,-n,24,-g,10.0.2.2,--dns-forward,10.0.2.3,--no-ndp,--no-dhcpv6,--no-dhcp**:
        same as above, but leave the MTU to 65520 bytes
    - **pasta:-t,auto,-u,auto,-T,auto,-U,auto**: enable automatic port forwarding
        based on observed bound ports from both host and container sides
    - **pasta:-T,5201**: enable forwarding of TCP port 5201 from container to
        host, using the loopback interface instead of the tap interface for improved
        performance

### `PodmanArgs=`

This key contains a list of arguments passed directly to the end of the `podman` command
in the generated file. It can be used to access Podman features otherwise unsupported
by the generator. Since the generator is unaware of what unexpected interactions can be
caused by these arguments, it is not recommended to use this option.

The format of this is a space separated list of arguments, which can optionally be individually
escaped to allow inclusion of whitespace and other control characters.

This key can be listed multiple times.

<< if is_quadlet >>
### `Pull=policy`
<< else >>
#### **--pull**=*policy*
<< endif >>

Pull image policy. The default is **missing**.

- **always**: Always pull the image and throw an error if the pull fails.
- **missing**: Pull the image only when the image is not in the local containers storage.  Throw an error if no image is found and the pull fails.
- **never**: Never pull the image but use the one from the local containers storage.  Throw an error if no image is found.
- **newer**: Pull if the image on the registry is newer than the one in the local containers storage.  An image is considered to be newer when the digests are different.  Comparing the time stamps is prone to errors.  Pull errors are suppressed if a local image was found.

<< if is_quadlet >>
### `Retry=attempts`
<< else >>
#### **--retry**=*attempts*
<< endif >>

Number of times to retry pulling or pushing images between the registry and
local storage in case of failure. Default is **3**.

<< if is_quadlet >>
### `RetryDelay=duration`
<< else >>
#### **--retry-delay**=*duration*
<< endif >>

Duration of delay between retry attempts when pulling or pushing images between
the registry and local storage in case of failure. The default is to start at two seconds and then exponentially back off. The delay is used when this value is set, and no exponential back off occurs.

<< if is_quadlet >>
### `Secret=secret[,opt=opt ...]`
<< else >>
#### **--secret**=*secret[,opt=opt ...]*
<< endif >>

Give the container access to a secret. Can be specified multiple times.

A secret is a blob of sensitive data which a container needs at runtime but
is not stored in the image or in source control, such as usernames and passwords,
TLS certificates and keys, SSH keys or other important generic strings or binary content (up to 512 kB in size).

When secrets are specified as type `mount`, the secrets are copied and mounted into the container when a container is created.
When secrets are specified as type `env`, the secret is set as an environment variable within the container.
Secrets are written in the container at the time of container creation, and modifying the secret using `podman secret` commands
after the container is created affects the secret inside the container.

Secrets and its storage are managed using the `podman secret` command.

Secret Options

- `type=mount|env`    : How the secret is exposed to the container.
                        `mount` mounts the secret into the container as a file.
                        `env` exposes the secret as an environment variable.
                        Defaults to `mount`.
- `target=target`     : Target of secret.
                        For mounted secrets, this is the path to the secret inside the container.
                        If a fully qualified path is provided, the secret is mounted at that location.
                        Otherwise, the secret is mounted to
                        `/run/secrets/target` for Linux containers or
                        `/var/run/secrets/target` for FreeBSD containers.
                        If the target is not set, the secret is mounted to `/run/secrets/secretname` by default.
                        For env secrets, this is the environment variable key. Defaults to `secretname`.
- `uid=0`             : UID of secret. Defaults to 0. Mount secret type only.
- `gid=0`             : GID of secret. Defaults to 0. Mount secret type only.
- `mode=0`            : Mode of secret. Defaults to 0444. Mount secret type only.

Examples

Mount at `/my/location/mysecret` with UID 1:
```
--secret mysecret,target=/my/location/mysecret,uid=1
```

Mount at `/run/secrets/customtarget` with mode 0777:
```
--secret mysecret,target=customtarget,mode=0777
```

Create a secret environment variable called `ENVSEC`:
```
--secret mysecret,type=env,target=ENVSEC
```

### `SetWorkingDirectory=path`

Provide context (a working directory) to `podman build`. Supported values are a path, a URL, or the
special keys `file` or `unit` to set the context directory to the parent directory of the file from
the `File=` key or to that of the Quadlet `.build` unit file, respectively. This allows Quadlet to
resolve relative paths.

When using one of the special keys (`file` or `unit`), the `WorkingDirectory` field of the `Service`
group of the Systemd service unit will also be set accordingly. Alternatively, users can
explicitly set the `WorkingDirectory` field of the `Service` group in the `.build` file. Please note
that if the `WorkingDirectory` field of the `Service` group is set by the user, Quadlet will not
overwrite it even if `SetWorkingDirectory` is set to `file` or `unit`.

By providing a URL to `SetWorkingDirectory=` you can instruct `podman build` to clone a Git
repository or download an archive file extracted to a temporary location by `podman build` as build
context. Note that in this case, the `WorkingDirectory` of the Systemd service unit is left
untouched by Quadlet.

Note that providing a context directory is mandatory for a `.build` file, unless a `File=` key has
also been provided.

<< if is_quadlet >>
### `Target=stageName`
<< else >>
#### **--target**=*stageName*
<< endif >>

Set the target build stage to build.  When building a Containerfile with multiple build stages, --target can be used to specify an intermediate build stage by name as the final stage for the resulting image. Commands after the target stage is skipped.

<< if is_quadlet >>
### `TLSVerify=`
<< else >>
#### **--tls-verify**
<< endif >>

Require HTTPS and verify certificates when contacting registries (default: **true**).
If explicitly set to **true**, TLS verification is used.
If set to **false**, TLS verification is not used.
If not specified, TLS verification is used unless the target registry
is listed as an insecure registry in **containers-registries.conf(5)**
