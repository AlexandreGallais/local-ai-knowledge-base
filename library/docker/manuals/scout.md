# Docker Scout

Container images consist of layers and software packages, which are susceptible to vulnerabilities.
These vulnerabilities can compromise the security of containers and applications.

Docker Scout is a solution for proactively enhancing your software supply chain security.
By analyzing your images, Docker Scout compiles an inventory of components, also known as a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).
The SBOM is matched against a continuously updated vulnerability database to pinpoint security weaknesses.

Docker Scout is a standalone service and platform that you can interact with
using Docker Hub, the Docker CLI, and the Docker Scout Dashboard.
