# Define services in Docker Compose (part 4 of 7)

### `healthcheck`

The `healthcheck` attribute declares a check that's run to determine whether or not the service containers are "healthy". It works in the same way, and has the same default values, as the HEALTHCHECK Dockerfile instruction
set by the service's Docker image. Your Compose file can override the values set in the Dockerfile.

For more information on `HEALTHCHECK`, see the Dockerfile reference.

```yml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost"]
  interval: 1m30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 40s
  start_interval: 5s
```

`interval`, `timeout`, `start_period`, and `start_interval` are specified as durations. Introduced in Docker Compose version 2.20.2

`test` defines the command Compose runs to check container health. It can be
either a string or a list. If it's a list, the first item must be either `NONE`, `CMD` or `CMD-SHELL`.
If it's a string, it's equivalent to specifying `CMD-SHELL` followed by that string.

```yml
# Hit the local web app
test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost"]
```

Using `CMD-SHELL` runs the command configured as a string using the container's default shell
(`/bin/sh` for Linux). Both of the following forms are equivalent:

```yml
test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost || exit 1"]
```

```yml
test: curl -f https://localhost || exit 1
```

`NONE` disables the healthcheck, and is mostly useful to disable the Healthcheck Dockerfile instruction set by the service's Docker image. Alternatively,
the healthcheck set by the image can be disabled by setting `disable: true`:

```yml
healthcheck:
  disable: true
```

### `hostname`

`hostname` declares a custom host name to use for the service container. It must be a valid RFC 1123 hostname.

### `image`

`image` specifies the image to start the container from. `image` must follow the Open Container Specification
addressable image format,
as `<registry>/<image>[:<tag>|@<digest>]`.

```yml
    image: redis
    image: redis:5
    image: redis@sha256:0ed5d5928d4737458944eb604cc8509e245c3e19d02ad83935398bc4b991aac7
    image: library/redis
    image: docker.io/library/redis
    image: my_private.registry:5000/redis
```

If the image does not exist on the platform, Compose attempts to pull it based on the `pull_policy`.
If you are also using the Compose Build Specification, there are alternative options for controlling the precedence of
pull over building the image from source, however pulling the image is the default behavior.

`image` may be omitted from a Compose file as long as a `build` section is declared. If you are not using the Compose Build Specification, Compose won't work if `image` is missing from the Compose file.

### `init`

`init` runs an init process (PID 1) inside the container that forwards signals and reaps processes.
Set this option to `true` to enable this feature for the service.

```yml
services:
  web:
    image: alpine:latest
    init: true
```

The init binary that is used is platform specific.

### `ipc`

`ipc` configures the IPC isolation mode set by the service container.

- `shareable`: Gives the container its own private IPC namespace, with a
  possibility to share it with other containers.
- `service:{name}`: Makes the container join another container's
  (`shareable`) IPC namespace.

```yml
    ipc: "shareable"
    ipc: "service:[service name]"
```

### `isolation`

`isolation` specifies a container’s isolation technology. Supported values are platform specific.

### `labels`

`labels` add metadata to containers. You can use either an array or a map.

It's recommended that you use reverse-DNS notation to prevent your labels from conflicting with
those used by other software.

```yml
labels:
  com.example.description: "Accounting webapp"
  com.example.department: "Finance"
  com.example.label-with-empty-value: ""
```

```yml
labels:
  - "com.example.description=Accounting webapp"
  - "com.example.department=Finance"
  - "com.example.label-with-empty-value"
```

Compose creates containers with canonical labels:

- `com.docker.compose.project` set on all resources created by Compose to the user project name
- `com.docker.compose.service` set on service containers with service name as defined in the Compose file

The `com.docker.compose` label prefix is reserved. Specifying labels with this prefix in the Compose file
results in a runtime error.

### `label_file`

The `label_file` attribute lets you load labels for a service from an external file or a list of files. This provides a convenient way to manage multiple labels without cluttering the Compose file.

The file uses a key-value format, similar to `env_file`. You can specify multiple files as a list. When using multiple files, they are processed in the order they appear in the list. If the same label is defined in multiple files, the value from the last file in the list overrides earlier ones.

```yaml
services:
  one:
    label_file: ./app.labels

  two:
    label_file:
      - ./app.labels
      - ./additional.labels
```

If a label is defined in both the `label_file` and the `labels` attribute, the value in labels takes precedence.

### `links`

`links` defines a network link to containers in another service. Either specify both the service name and
a link alias (`SERVICE:ALIAS`), or just the service name.

```yml
web:
  links:
    - db
    - db:database
    - redis
```

Containers for the linked service are reachable at a hostname identical to the alias, or the service name
if no alias is specified.

Links are not required to enable services to communicate. When no specific network configuration is set,
any service is able to reach any other service at that service’s name on the `default` network.
If services specify the networks they are attached to, `links` does not override the network configuration. Services that are not connected to a shared network are not be able to communicate with each other. Compose doesn't warn you about a configuration mismatch.

Links also express implicit dependency between services in the same way as
`depends_on`, so they determine the order of service startup.

### `logging`

`logging` defines the logging configuration for the service.

```yml
logging:
  driver: syslog
  options:
    syslog-address: "tcp://192.168.0.42:123"
```

The `driver` name specifies a logging driver for the service's containers. The default and available values
are platform specific. Driver specific options can be set with `options` as key-value pairs.

### `mac_address`

> Available with Docker Compose version 2.24.0 and later.

`mac_address` sets a Mac address for the service container.

> **Note:**
> Container runtimes might reject this value, for example Docker Engine >= v25.0. In that case, you should use networks.mac_address instead.

### `mem_limit`

`mem_limit` configures a limit on the amount of memory a container can allocate, set as a string expressing a byte value.

When set, `mem_limit` must be consistent with the `limits.memory` attribute in the Deploy Specification.

### `mem_reservation`

`mem_reservation` configures a reservation on the amount of memory a container can allocate, set as a string expressing a byte value.

When set, `mem_reservation` must be consistent with the `reservations.memory` attribute in the Deploy Specification.

### `mem_swappiness`

`mem_swappiness` defines as a percentage, a value between 0 and 100, for the host kernel to swap out
anonymous memory pages used by a container.

- `0`: Turns off anonymous page swapping.
- `100`: Sets all anonymous pages as swappable.

The default value is platform specific.

### `memswap_limit`

`memswap_limit` defines the amount of memory the container is allowed to swap to disk. This is a modifier
attribute that only has meaning if `memory` is also set. Using swap lets the container write excess
memory requirements to disk when the container has exhausted all the memory that is available to it.
There is a performance penalty for applications that swap memory to disk often.

- If `memswap_limit` is set to a positive integer, then both `memory` and `memswap_limit` must be set. `memswap_limit` represents the total amount of memory and swap that can be used, and `memory` controls the amount used by non-swap memory. So if `memory`="300m" and `memswap_limit`="1g", the container can use 300m of memory and 700m (1g - 300m) swap.
- If `memswap_limit` is set to 0, the setting is ignored, and the value is treated as unset.
- If `memswap_limit` is set to the same value as `memory`, and `memory` is set to a positive integer, the container does not have access to swap.
- If `memswap_limit` is unset, and `memory` is set, the container can use as much swap as the `memory` setting, if the host has swap memory configured. For instance, if `memory`="300m" and `memswap_limit` is not set, the container can use 600m in total of memory and swap.
- If `memswap_limit` is explicitly set to -1, the container is allowed to use unlimited swap, up to the amount available on the host system.

### `models`

`models` defines which AI models the service should use at runtime. Each referenced model must be defined under the `models` top-level element.

```yaml
services:
  short_syntax:
    image: app
    models:
      - my_model
  long_syntax:
    image: app
    models:
      my_model:
        endpoint_var: MODEL_URL
        model_var: MODEL
```

When a service is linked to a model, Docker Compose injects environment variables to pass connection details and model identifiers to the container. This allows the application to locate and communicate with the model dynamically at runtime, without hard-coding values.

#### Long syntax

The long syntax gives you more control over the environment variable names.

- `endpoint_var` sets the name of the environment variable that holds the model runner’s URL.
- `model_var` sets the name of the environment variable that holds the model identifier.

If either is omitted, Compose automatically generates the environment variable names based on the model key using the following rules:

 - Convert the model key to uppercase
 - Replace any '-' characters with '_'
 - Append `_URL` for the endpoint variable

### `network_mode`

`network_mode` sets a service container's network mode.

- `bridge`: Connects the container to Docker's default bridge network instead of
  a project-specific network. Containers on the default bridge network cannot
  resolve each other by service name . Instead, use a user-defined network for DNS resolution.
- `none`: Turns off all container networking.
- `host`: Gives the container raw access to the host's network interface.
- `service:{name}`: Gives the container access to the specified container by referring to its service name.
- `container:{name}`: Gives the container access to the specified container by referring to its container ID.

For more information container networks, see the Docker Engine documentation.

```yml
    network_mode: "bridge"
    network_mode: "host"
    network_mode: "none"
    network_mode: "service:[service name]"
```

When set, the `networks` attribute is not allowed and Compose rejects any
Compose file containing both attributes.
