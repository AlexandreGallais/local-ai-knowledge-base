A service is an abstract definition of a computing resource within an application which can be scaled or replaced
independently from other components. Services are backed by a set of containers, run by the platform
according to replication requirements and placement constraints. As services are backed by containers, they are defined
by a Docker image and set of runtime arguments. All containers within a service are identically created with these
arguments.

A Compose file must declare a `services` top-level element as a map whose keys are string representations of service names,
and whose values are service definitions. A service definition contains the configuration that is applied to each
service container.

Each service may also include a `build` section, which defines how to create the Docker image for the service.
Compose supports building Docker images using this service definition. If not used, the `build` section is ignored and the Compose file is still considered valid. Build support is an optional aspect of the Compose Specification, and is
described in detail in the Compose Build Specification documentation.

Each service defines runtime constraints and requirements to run its containers. The `deploy` section groups
these constraints and lets the platform adjust the deployment strategy to best match containers' needs with
available resources. Deploy support is an optional aspect of the Compose Specification, and is
described in detail in the Compose Deploy Specification documentation.
If not implemented the `deploy` section is ignored and the Compose file is still considered valid.

## Examples

### Simple example

The following example demonstrates how to define two simple services, set their images, map ports, and configure basic environment variables using Docker Compose.

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"

  db:
    image: postgres:18
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: example
      POSTGRES_DB: exampledb
```

### Advanced example

In the following example, the `proxy` service uses the Nginx image, mounts a local Nginx configuration file into the container, exposes port `80` and depends on the `backend` service.

The `backend` service builds an image from the Dockerfile located in the `backend` directory that is set to build at stage `builder`.

```yaml
services:
  proxy:
    image: nginx
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./proxy/nginx.conf
        target: /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
        read_only: true
    ports:
      - 80:80
    depends_on:
      - backend

  backend:
    build:
      context: backend
      target: builder
```
