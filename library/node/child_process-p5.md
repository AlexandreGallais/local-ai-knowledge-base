# Child process (part 5 of 8)

```mjs
import { spawn } from 'node:child_process';
import process from 'node:process';

// Child will use parent's stdios.
spawn('prg', [], { stdio: 'inherit' });

// Spawn child sharing only stderr.
spawn('prg', [], { stdio: ['pipe', 'pipe', process.stderr] });

// Open an extra fd=4, to interact with programs presenting a
// startd-style interface.
spawn('prg', [], { stdio: ['pipe', null, null, null, 'pipe'] });
```

_It is worth noting that when an IPC channel is established between the
parent and child processes, and the child process is a Node.js instance,
the child process is launched with the IPC channel unreferenced (using
`unref()`) until the child process registers an event handler for the
`'disconnect'` event or the `'message'` event. This allows the
child process to exit normally without the process being held open by the
open IPC channel._
See also: `child_process.exec()` and `child_process.fork()`.

## Synchronous process creation

The `child_process.spawnSync()`, `child_process.execSync()`, and
`child_process.execFileSync()` methods are synchronous and will block the
Node.js event loop, pausing execution of any additional code until the spawned
process exits.

Blocking calls like these are mostly useful for simplifying general-purpose
scripting tasks and for simplifying the loading/processing of application
configuration at startup.

### `child_process.execFileSync(file, args)`

* `file` {string} The name or path of the executable file to run.
* `args` {string\[]} List of string arguments.
* `options` {Object}
  * `cwd` {string|URL} Current working directory of the child process.
  * `input` {string|Buffer|TypedArray|DataView} The value which will be passed
    as stdin to the spawned process. If `stdio[0]` is set to `'pipe'`, Supplying
    this value will override `stdio[0]`.
  * `stdio` {string|Array} Child's stdio configuration.
    See `child_process.spawn()`'s `stdio`. `stderr` by default will
    be output to the parent process' stderr unless `stdio` is specified.
    **Default:** `'pipe'`.
  * `env` {Object} Environment key-value pairs. **Default:** `process.env`.
  * `uid` {number} Sets the user identity of the process (see setuid(2)).
  * `gid` {number} Sets the group identity of the process (see setgid(2)).
  * `timeout` {number} In milliseconds the maximum amount of time the process
    is allowed to run. **Default:** `undefined`.
  * `killSignal` {string|integer} The signal value to be used when the spawned
    process will be killed. **Default:** `'SIGTERM'`.
  * `maxBuffer` {number} Largest amount of data in bytes allowed on stdout or
    stderr. If exceeded, the child process is terminated. See caveat at
    `maxBuffer` and Unicode. **Default:** `1024 * 1024`.
  * `encoding` {string} The encoding used for all stdio inputs and outputs.
    **Default:** `'buffer'`.
  * `windowsHide` {boolean} Hide the subprocess console window that would
    normally be created on Windows systems. **Default:** `false`.
  * `shell` {boolean|string} If `true`, runs `command` inside of a shell. Uses
    `'/bin/sh'` on Unix, and `process.env.ComSpec` on Windows. A different
    shell can be specified as a string. See Shell requirements and
    Default Windows shell. **Default:** `false` (no shell).
* Returns: {Buffer|string|null} If `stdio` is `'pipe'`, the stdout from the
  command, otherwise null.

The `child_process.execFileSync()` method is generally identical to
`child_process.execFile()` with the exception that the method will not
return until the child process has fully closed. When a timeout has been
encountered and `killSignal` is sent, the method won't return until the process
has completely exited.

If the child process intercepts and handles the `SIGTERM` signal and
does not exit, the parent process will still wait until the child process has
exited.

If the process times out or has a non-zero exit code, this method will throw an
`Error` that will include the full result of the underlying
`child_process.spawnSync()`.

**If the `shell` option is enabled, do not pass unsanitized user input to this
function. Any input containing shell metacharacters may be used to trigger
arbitrary command execution.**

```cjs
const { execFileSync } = require('node:child_process');

try {
  const stdout = execFileSync('my-script.sh', ['my-arg'], {
    // Capture stdout and stderr from child process. Overrides the
    // default behavior of streaming child stderr to the parent stderr
    stdio: 'pipe',

    // Use utf8 encoding for stdio pipes
    encoding: 'utf8',
  });

  console.log(stdout);
} catch (err) {
  if (err.code) {
    // Spawning child process failed
    console.error(err.code);
  } else {
    // Child was spawned but exited with non-zero exit code
    // Error contains any stdout and stderr from the child
    const { stdout, stderr } = err;

    console.error({ stdout, stderr });
  }
}
```

```mjs
import { execFileSync } from 'node:child_process';

try {
  const stdout = execFileSync('my-script.sh', ['my-arg'], {
    // Capture stdout and stderr from child process. Overrides the
    // default behavior of streaming child stderr to the parent stderr
    stdio: 'pipe',

    // Use utf8 encoding for stdio pipes
    encoding: 'utf8',
  });

  console.log(stdout);
} catch (err) {
  if (err.code) {
    // Spawning child process failed
    console.error(err.code);
  } else {
    // Child was spawned but exited with non-zero exit code
    // Error contains any stdout and stderr from the child
    const { stdout, stderr } = err;

    console.error({ stdout, stderr });
  }
}
```

### `child_process.execSync(command[, options])`

* `options` {Object}
  * `cwd` {string|URL} Current working directory of the child process.
  * `input` {string|Buffer|TypedArray|DataView} The value which will be passed
    as stdin to the spawned process. If `stdio[0]` is set to `'pipe'`, Supplying
    this value will override `stdio[0]`.
  * `stdio` {string|Array} Child's stdio configuration.
    See `child_process.spawn()`'s `stdio`. `stderr` by default will

  * `env` {Object} Environment key-value pairs. **Default:** `process.env`.
  * `shell` {string} Shell to execute the command with. See
    Shell requirements and Default Windows shell. **Default:**
    `'/bin/sh'` on Unix, `process.env.ComSpec` on Windows.
  * `uid` {number} Sets the user identity of the process. (See setuid(2)).
  * `gid` {number} Sets the group identity of the process. (See setgid(2)).
  * `timeout` {number} In milliseconds the maximum amount of time the process
    is allowed to run. **Default:** `undefined`.
  * `killSignal` {string|integer} The signal value to be used when the spawned
    process will be killed. **Default:** `'SIGTERM'`.
  * `maxBuffer` {number} Largest amount of data in bytes allowed on stdout or
    stderr. If exceeded, the child process is terminated and any output is
    truncated. See caveat at `maxBuffer` and Unicode.
    **Default:** `1024 * 1024`.
  * `encoding` {string} The encoding used for all stdio inputs and outputs.
    **Default:** `'buffer'`.
