```vb

    End Property

    Public ReadOnly Property FirstDivisor() As Integer
        Get
            ' Raise an exception if the operation failed 
            ' or was canceled.
            RaiseExceptionIfNecessary()

            ' If the operation was successful, return 
            ' the property value.
            Return firstDivisorValue
        End Get
    End Property

    Public ReadOnly Property IsPrime() As Boolean
        Get
            ' Raise an exception if the operation failed 
            ' or was canceled.
            RaiseExceptionIfNecessary()

            ' If the operation was successful, return

4. Implement `IsPrime`. It takes three parameters: a list of known prime numbers, the number to test, and an output parameter for the first divisor found. Given the list of prime numbers, it determines if the test number is prime.
