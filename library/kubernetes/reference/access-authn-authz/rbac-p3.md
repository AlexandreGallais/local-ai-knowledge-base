# Using RBAC Authorization (part 3 of 5)

### Aggregated ClusterRoles

You can _aggregate_ several ClusterRoles into one combined ClusterRole.
A controller, running as part of the cluster control plane, watches for ClusterRole
objects with an `aggregationRule` set. The `aggregationRule` defines a label
selector that the controller
uses to match other ClusterRole objects that should be combined into the `rules`
field of this one.

**Caution:**
The control plane overwrites any values that you manually specify in the `rules` field of an
aggregate ClusterRole. If you want to change or add rules, do so in the `ClusterRole` objects
that are selected by the `aggregationRule`.

Omit the `rules` field from manifests for aggregated ClusterRoles. Setting it, even to an
empty list, claims ownership of the field when the manifest is applied with
server-side apply. That ownership causes
conflicts between the applier and the control plane: subsequent applies either fail with a
field manager conflict on `.rules`, or (if conflicts are forced, as GitOps controllers
typically do) repeatedly clear the aggregated rules, which the control plane then fills in
again.

Here is an example aggregated ClusterRole:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: monitoring
aggregationRule:
  clusterRoleSelectors:
  - matchLabels:
      rbac.example.com/aggregate-to-monitoring: "true"
# The control plane automatically fills in the rules
```

If you create a new ClusterRole that matches the label selector of an existing aggregated ClusterRole,
that change triggers adding the new rules into the aggregated ClusterRole.
Here is an example that adds rules to the "monitoring" ClusterRole, by creating another
ClusterRole labeled `rbac.example.com/aggregate-to-monitoring: true`.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: monitoring-endpointslices
  labels:
    rbac.example.com/aggregate-to-monitoring: "true"
# When you create the "monitoring-endpointslices" ClusterRole,
# the rules below will be added to the "monitoring" ClusterRole.
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["services", "pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: ["discovery.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["endpointslices"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

The default user-facing roles use ClusterRole aggregation. This lets you,
as a cluster administrator, include rules for custom resources, such as those served by
CustomResourceDefinitions
or aggregated API servers, to extend the default roles.

For example: the following ClusterRoles let the "admin" and "edit" default roles manage the custom resource
named CronTab, whereas the "view" role can perform only read actions on CronTab resources.
You can assume that CronTab objects are named `"crontabs"` in URLs as seen by the API server.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: aggregate-cron-tabs-edit
  labels:
    # Add these permissions to the "admin" and "edit" default roles.
    rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-admin: "true"
    rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-edit: "true"
rules:
- apiGroups: ["stable.example.com"]
  resources: ["crontabs"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
---
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: aggregate-cron-tabs-view
  labels:
    # Add these permissions to the "view" default role.
    rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-view: "true"
rules:
- apiGroups: ["stable.example.com"]
  resources: ["crontabs"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

#### Role examples

The following examples are excerpts from Role or ClusterRole objects, showing only
the `rules` section.

Allow reading `"pods"` resources in the core
API Group:

```yaml
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  #
  # at the HTTP level, the name of the resource for accessing Pod
  # objects is "pods"
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

Allow reading/writing Deployments (at the HTTP level: objects with `"deployments"`
in the resource part of their URL) in the `"apps"` API groups:

```yaml
rules:
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  #
  # at the HTTP level, the name of the resource for accessing Deployment
  # objects is "deployments"
  resources: ["deployments"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
```

Allow reading Pods in the core API group, as well as reading or writing Job
resources in the `"batch"` API group:

```yaml
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  #
  # at the HTTP level, the name of the resource for accessing Pod
  # objects is "pods"
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: ["batch"]
  #
  # at the HTTP level, the name of the resource for accessing Job
  # objects is "jobs"
  resources: ["jobs"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
```

Allow reading a ConfigMap named "my-config" (must be bound with a
RoleBinding to limit to a single ConfigMap in a single namespace):

```yaml
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  #
  # at the HTTP level, the name of the resource for accessing ConfigMap
  # objects is "configmaps"
  resources: ["configmaps"]
  resourceNames: ["my-config"]
  verbs: ["get"]
```

Allow reading the resource `"nodes"` in the core group (because a
Node is cluster-scoped, this must be in a ClusterRole bound with a
ClusterRoleBinding to be effective):

```yaml
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  #
  # at the HTTP level, the name of the resource for accessing Node
  # objects is "nodes"
  resources: ["nodes"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

Allow GET and POST requests to the non-resource endpoint `/healthz` and
all subpaths (must be in a ClusterRole bound with a ClusterRoleBinding
to be effective):

```yaml
rules:
- nonResourceURLs: ["/healthz", "/healthz/*"] # '*' in a nonResourceURL is a suffix glob match
  verbs: ["get", "post"]
```

### Referring to subjects

A RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding binds a role to subjects.
Subjects can be groups, users or
ServiceAccounts.

Kubernetes represents usernames as strings.
These can be: plain names, such as "alice"; email-style names, like "bob@example.com";
or numeric user IDs represented as a string. It is up to you as a cluster administrator
to configure the authentication modules
so that authentication produces usernames in the format you want.

**Caution:**
The prefix `system:` is reserved for Kubernetes system use, so you should ensure
that you don't have users or groups with names that start with `system:` by
accident.
Other than this special prefix, the RBAC authorization system does not require any format
for usernames.

In Kubernetes, Authenticator modules provide group information.
Groups, like users, are represented as strings, and that string has no format requirements,
other than that the prefix `system:` is reserved.

ServiceAccounts have names prefixed
with `system:serviceaccount:`, and belong to groups that have names prefixed with `system:serviceaccounts:`.

**Note:**
- `system:serviceaccount:` (singular) is the prefix for service account usernames.
- `system:serviceaccounts:` (plural) is the prefix for service account groups.

#### RoleBinding examples {#role-binding-examples}

The following examples are `RoleBinding` excerpts that only
show the `subjects` section.

For a user named `alice@example.com`:

```yaml
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: "alice@example.com"
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

For a group named `frontend-admins`:

```yaml
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: "frontend-admins"
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

For the default service account in the "kube-system" namespace:

```yaml
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: default
  namespace: kube-system
```

For all service accounts in the "qa" namespace:

```yaml
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: system:serviceaccounts:qa
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

For all service accounts in any namespace:

```yaml
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: system:serviceaccounts
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

For all authenticated users:

```yaml
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: system:authenticated
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

For all unauthenticated users:

```yaml
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: system:unauthenticated
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

For all users:

```yaml
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: system:authenticated
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
- kind: Group
  name: system:unauthenticated
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
