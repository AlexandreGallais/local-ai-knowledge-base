# user namespace

A kernel feature to emulate root. Used for "rootless containers".

User namespaces are a Linux kernel feature that allows a non-root user to
emulate superuser ("root") privileges,
for example in order to run containers without being a superuser outside the container.

User namespace is effective for mitigating damage of potential container break-out attacks.

In the context of user namespaces, the namespace is a Linux kernel feature, and not a
namespace in the Kubernetes sense
of the term.
