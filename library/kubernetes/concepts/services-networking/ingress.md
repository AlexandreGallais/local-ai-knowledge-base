# Ingress

**Feature state:** v1.19 [stable]

**Note:**
The Kubernetes project recommends using Gateway instead of
Ingress.
The Ingress API has been frozen.

This means that:
* The Ingress API is generally available, and is subject to the stability guarantees for generally available APIs.
  The Kubernetes project has no plans to remove Ingress from Kubernetes.
* The Ingress API is no longer being developed, and will have no further changes
  or updates made to it.

## Terminology

For clarity, this guide defines the following terms:

* Node: A worker machine in Kubernetes, part of a cluster.
* Cluster: A set of Nodes that run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes.
  For this example, and in most common Kubernetes deployments, nodes in the cluster
  are not part of the public internet.
* Edge router: A router that enforces the firewall policy for your cluster. This
  could be a gateway managed by a cloud provider or a physical piece of hardware.
* Cluster network: A set of links, logical or physical, that facilitate communication
  within a cluster according to the Kubernetes networking model.
* Service: A Kubernetes service that identifies
  a set of Pods using label selectors.
  Unless mentioned otherwise, Services are assumed to have virtual IPs only routable within the cluster network.

## What is Ingress?

Ingress
exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to
 within the cluster.
Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.

Here is a simple example where an Ingress sends all its traffic to one Service:

An Ingress may be configured to give Services externally-reachable URLs,
load balance traffic, terminate SSL / TLS, and offer name-based virtual hosting.
An Ingress controller
is responsible for fulfilling the Ingress, usually with a load balancer, though
it may also configure your edge router or additional frontends to help handle the traffic.

An Ingress does not expose arbitrary ports or protocols. Exposing services other than HTTP and HTTPS to the internet typically
uses a service of type Service.Type=NodePort or
Service.Type=LoadBalancer.

## Prerequisites

You must have an Ingress controller
to satisfy an Ingress. Only creating an Ingress resource has no effect.

You can choose from a number of Ingress controllers.

Ideally, all Ingress controllers should fit the reference specification. In reality, the various Ingress
controllers operate slightly differently.

**Note:**
Make sure you review your Ingress controller's documentation to understand the caveats of choosing it.

## The Ingress resource

A minimal Ingress resource example:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: minimal-ingress
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx-example
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /testpath
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: test
            port:
              number: 80
```

An Ingress needs `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata` and `spec` fields.
The name of an Ingress object must be a valid
DNS subdomain name.
For general information about working with config files, see
deploying applications,
configuring containers,
managing resources.
Ingress controllers frequently use annotations to configure behavior.
Review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are expected and / or supported.

The Ingress spec
has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server. Most importantly, it
contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests. Ingress resource only supports rules
for directing HTTP(S) traffic.

If the `ingressClassName` is omitted, a default Ingress class
should be defined.

Some ingress controllers work even without the definition of a
default IngressClass. Even if you use an ingress controller that is able
to operate without any IngressClass, the Kubernetes project still recommends
that you define a default IngressClass.

### Ingress rules

Each HTTP rule contains the following information:

* An optional host. In this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound
  HTTP traffic through the IP address specified. If a host is provided (for example,
  foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
* A list of paths (for example, `/testpath`), each of which has an associated
  backend defined with a `service.name` and a `service.port.name` or
  `service.port.number`. Both the host and path must match the content of an
  incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced
  Service.
* A backend is a combination of Service and port names as described in the
  Service doc or a custom resource backend
  by way of a CRD. HTTP (and HTTPS) requests to the
  Ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.

A `defaultBackend` is often configured in an Ingress controller to service any requests that do not
match a path in the spec.

### DefaultBackend {#default-backend}

An Ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and `.spec.defaultBackend`
is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
The `defaultBackend` is conventionally a configuration option of the
Ingress controller and
is not specified in your Ingress resources.
If no `.spec.rules` are specified, `.spec.defaultBackend` must be specified.
If `defaultBackend` is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the
ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).

If none of the hosts or paths match the HTTP request in the Ingress objects, the traffic is
routed to your default backend.

### Resource backends {#resource-backend}

A `Resource` backend is an ObjectRef to another Kubernetes resource within the
same namespace as the Ingress object. A `Resource` is a mutually exclusive
setting with Service, and will fail validation if both are specified. A common
usage for a `Resource` backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend
with static assets.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-resource-backend
spec:
  defaultBackend:
    resource:
      apiGroup: k8s.example.com
      kind: StorageBucket
      name: static-assets
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: /icons
            pathType: ImplementationSpecific
            backend:
              resource:
                apiGroup: k8s.example.com
                kind: StorageBucket
                name: icon-assets
```

After creating the Ingress above, you can view it with the following command:

```bash
kubectl describe ingress ingress-resource-backend
```

```
Name:             ingress-resource-backend
Namespace:        default
Address:
Default backend:  APIGroup: k8s.example.com, Kind: StorageBucket, Name: static-assets
Rules:
  Host        Path  Backends
  ----        ----  --------
  *
              /icons   APIGroup: k8s.example.com, Kind: StorageBucket, Name: icon-assets
Annotations:  <none>
Events:       <none>
```

### Path types

Each path in an Ingress is required to have a corresponding path type. Paths
that do not include an explicit `pathType` will fail validation. There are three
supported path types:

* `ImplementationSpecific`: With this path type, matching is up to the
  IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate `pathType` or treat
  it identically to `Prefix` or `Exact` path types.

* `Exact`: Matches the URL path exactly and with case sensitivity.

* `Prefix`: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by `/`. Matching is case
  sensitive and done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers
  to the list of labels in the path split by the `/` separator. A request is a
  match for path _p_ if every _p_ is an element-wise prefix of _p_ of the
  request path.

  **Note:**
  If the last element of the path is a substring of the last
  element in request path, it is not a match (for example: `/foo/bar`
  matches `/foo/bar/baz`, but does not match `/foo/barbaz`).

### Examples

| Kind   | Path(s)                         | Request path(s)               | Matches?                           |
|--------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Prefix | `/`                             | (all paths)                   | Yes                                |
| Exact  | `/foo`                          | `/foo`                        | Yes                                |

| Prefix | `/foo/`                         | `/foo`, `/foo/`               | Yes                                |
| Prefix | `/aaa/bb`                       | `/aaa/bbb`                    | No                                 |
| Prefix | `/aaa/bbb`                      | `/aaa/bbb`                    | Yes                                |
| Prefix | `/aaa/bbb/`                     | `/aaa/bbb`                    | Yes, ignores trailing slash        |
| Prefix | `/aaa/bbb`                      | `/aaa/bbb/`                   | Yes,  matches trailing slash       |
| Prefix | `/aaa/bbb`                      | `/aaa/bbb/ccc`                | Yes, matches subpath               |

| Mixed  | `/foo` (Prefix), `/foo` (Exact) | `/foo`                        | Yes, prefers Exact                 |

#### Multiple matches

In some cases, multiple paths within an Ingress will match a request. In those
cases precedence will be given first to the longest matching path. If two paths
are still equally matched, precedence will be given to paths with an exact path
type over prefix path type.

## Hostname wildcards

Hosts can be precise matches (for example “`foo.bar.com`”) or a wildcard (for
example “`*.foo.com`”). Precise matches require that the HTTP `host` header
matches the `host` field. Wildcard matches require the HTTP `host` header is
equal to the suffix of the wildcard rule.

| Host        | Host header       | Match?                                            |
| ----------- |-------------------| --------------------------------------------------|
| `*.foo.com` | `bar.foo.com`     | Matches based on shared suffix                    |
| `*.foo.com` | `baz.bar.foo.com` | No match, wildcard only covers a single DNS label |
| `*.foo.com` | `foo.com`         | No match, wildcard only covers a single DNS label |

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-wildcard-host
spec:
  rules:
  - host: "foo.bar.com"
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/bar"
        backend:
          service:
            name: service1
            port:
              number: 80
  - host: "*.foo.com"
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/foo"
        backend:
          service:
            name: service2
            port:
              number: 80
```
