# Component testing scenarios (part 4 of 4)

## Use a `page` object

The `HeroDetail` component is a simple view with a title, two hero fields, and two buttons.

But there's plenty of template complexity even in this simple form.

```angular-html
@if (hero) {
  <div>
    <h2>
      <span>{{ hero.name | titlecase }}</span> Details
    </h2>
    <div><span>id: </span>{{ hero.id }}</div>
    <div>
      <label for="name">name: </label>
      <input id="name" [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name" />
    </div>
    <button type="button" (click)="save()">Save</button>
    <button type="button" (click)="cancel()">Cancel</button>
  </div>
}
```

Tests that exercise the component need …

- To wait until a hero arrives before elements appear in the DOM
- A reference to the title text
- A reference to the name input box to inspect and set it
- References to the two buttons so they can click them

Even a small form such as this one can produce a mess of tortured conditional setup and CSS element selection.

Tame the complexity with a `Page` class that handles access to component properties and encapsulates the logic that sets them.

Here is such a `Page` class for the `hero-detail.component.spec.ts`

```ts
class Page {
  // getter properties wait to query the DOM until called.
  get buttons() {
    return this.queryAll<HTMLButtonElement>('button');
  }
  get saveBtn() {
    return this.buttons[0];
  }
  get cancelBtn() {
    return this.buttons[1];
  }
  get nameDisplay() {
    return this.query<HTMLElement>('span');
  }
  get nameInput() {
    return this.query<HTMLInputElement>('input');
  }

  //// query helpers ////
  private query<T>(selector: string): T {
    return harness.routeNativeElement!.querySelector(selector)! as T;
  }

  private queryAll<T>(selector: string): T[] {
    return harness.routeNativeElement!.querySelectorAll(selector) as any as T[];
  }
}
```

Now the important hooks for component manipulation and inspection are neatly organized and accessible from an instance of `Page`.

A `createComponent` method creates a `page` object and fills in the blanks once the `hero` arrives.

```ts
async function createComponent(id: number) {
  harness = await RouterTestingHarness.create();
  component = await harness.navigateByUrl(`/heroes/${id}`, HeroDetail);
  page = new Page();

  const request = TestBed.inject(HttpTestingController).expectOne(`api/heroes/?id=${id}`);
  const hero = getTestHeroes().find((h) => h.id === Number(id));
  request.flush(hero ? [hero] : []);
  await harness.fixture.whenStable();
}
```

Here are a few more `HeroDetail` component tests to reinforce the point.

```ts
it("should display that hero's name", () => {
  expect(page.nameDisplay.textContent).toBe(expectedHero.name);
});

it('should navigate when click cancel', () => {
  click(page.cancelBtn);
  expect(TestBed.inject(Router).url).toEqual(`/heroes/${expectedHero.id}`);
});

it('should save when click save but not navigate immediately', () => {
  click(page.saveBtn);
  expect(TestBed.inject(HttpTestingController).expectOne({method: 'PUT', url: 'api/heroes'}));
  expect(TestBed.inject(Router).url).toEqual('/heroes/41');
});

it('should navigate when click save and save resolves', async () => {
  click(page.saveBtn);
  await harness.fixture.whenStable();
  expect(TestBed.inject(Router).url).toEqual('/heroes/41');
});

it('should convert hero name to Title Case', async () => {
  // get the name's input and display elements from the DOM
  const hostElement: HTMLElement = harness.routeNativeElement!;
  const nameInput: HTMLInputElement = hostElement.querySelector('input')!;
  const nameDisplay: HTMLElement = hostElement.querySelector('span')!;

  // simulate user entering a new name into the input box
  nameInput.value = 'quick BROWN  fOx';

  // Dispatch a DOM event so that Angular learns of input value change.
  nameInput.dispatchEvent(new Event('input'));

  // Wait for Angular to update the display binding through the title pipe
  await harness.fixture.whenStable();

  expect(nameDisplay.textContent).toBe('Quick Brown  Fox');
});
```

## Override component providers

The `HeroDetail` provides its own `HeroDetailService`.

```ts
@Component({
  /* ... */
  providers: [HeroDetailService],
})
export class HeroDetail {
  private heroDetailService = inject(HeroDetailService);
  private route = inject(ActivatedRoute);
  private router = inject(Router);
}
```

It's not possible to stub the component's `HeroDetailService` in the `providers` of the `TestBed.configureTestingModule`.
Those are providers for the _testing module_, not the component.
They prepare the dependency injector at the _fixture level_.

Angular creates the component with its _own_ injector, which is a _child_ of the fixture injector.
It registers the component's providers \(the `HeroDetailService` in this case\) with the child injector.

A test cannot get to child injector services from the fixture injector.
And `TestBed.configureTestingModule` can't configure them either.

Angular has created new instances of the real `HeroDetailService` all along!

HELPFUL: These tests could fail or timeout if the `HeroDetailService` made its own XHR calls to a remote server.
There might not be a remote server to call.

Fortunately, the `HeroDetailService` delegates responsibility for remote data access to an injected `HeroService`.

```ts
@Service()
export class HeroDetailService {
  private heroService = inject(HeroService);
}
```

The previous test configuration replaces the real `HeroService` with a `TestHeroService` that intercepts server requests and fakes their responses.

What if you aren't so lucky.
What if faking the `HeroService` is hard?
What if `HeroDetailService` makes its own server requests?

The `TestBed.overrideComponent` method can replace the component's `providers` with easy-to-manage _test doubles_ as seen in the following setup variation:

```ts
beforeEach(async () => {
  await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    providers: [
      provideRouter([
        {path: 'heroes', component: HeroList},
        {path: 'heroes/:id', component: HeroDetail},
      ]),
      // HeroDetailService at this level is IRRELEVANT!
      {provide: HeroDetailService, useValue: {}},
    ],
  }).overrideComponent(HeroDetail, {
    set: {providers: [{provide: HeroDetailService, useClass: HeroDetailServiceSpy}]},
  });
});
```

Notice that `TestBed.configureTestingModule` no longer provides a fake `HeroService` because it's not needed.

### The `overrideComponent` method

Focus on the `overrideComponent` method.

```ts
.overrideComponent(HeroDetail, {
  set: {providers: [{provide: HeroDetailService, useClass: HeroDetailServiceSpy}]},
});
```

It takes two arguments: the component type to override \(`HeroDetail`\) and an override metadata object.
The override metadata object is a generic defined as follows:

```ts
type MetadataOverride<T> = {
  add?: Partial<T>;
  remove?: Partial<T>;
  set?: Partial<T>;
};
```

A metadata override object can either add-and-remove elements in metadata properties or completely reset those properties.
This example resets the component's `providers` metadata.

The type parameter, `T`, is the kind of metadata you'd pass to the `@Component` decorator:

```ts
selector?: string;
template?: string;
templateUrl?: string;
providers?: any[];
…
```

### Provide a _spy stub_ (`HeroDetailServiceSpy`)

This example completely replaces the component's `providers` array with a new array containing a `HeroDetailServiceSpy`.

The `HeroDetailServiceSpy` is a stubbed version of the real `HeroDetailService` that fakes all necessary features of that service.
It neither injects nor delegates to the lower level `HeroService` so there's no need to provide a test double for that.

The related `HeroDetail` component tests will assert that methods of the `HeroDetailService` were called by spying on the service methods.
Accordingly, the stub implements its methods as spies:

```ts
import {vi} from 'vitest';

class HeroDetailServiceSpy {
  testHero: Hero = {...testHero};

  /* emit cloned test hero */
  getHero = vi.fn(() => asyncData({...this.testHero}));

  /* emit clone of test hero, with changes merged in */
  saveHero = vi.fn((hero: Hero) => asyncData(Object.assign(this.testHero, hero)));
}
```

### The override tests

Now the tests can control the component's hero directly by manipulating the spy-stub's `testHero` and confirm that service methods were called.

```ts
let hdsSpy: HeroDetailServiceSpy;

beforeEach(async () => {
  harness = await RouterTestingHarness.create();
  component = await harness.navigateByUrl(`/heroes/${testHero.id}`, HeroDetail);
  page = new Page();
  // get the component's injected HeroDetailServiceSpy
  hdsSpy = harness.routeDebugElement!.injector.get(HeroDetailService) as any;

  harness.detectChanges();
});

it('should have called `getHero`', () => {
  expect(hdsSpy.getHero, 'getHero called once').toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});

it("should display stub hero's name", () => {
  expect(page.nameDisplay.textContent).toBe(hdsSpy.testHero.name);
});

it('should save stub hero change', async () => {
  const origName = hdsSpy.testHero.name;
  const newName = 'New Name';

  page.nameInput.value = newName;

  page.nameInput.dispatchEvent(new Event('input')); // tell Angular

  expect(component.hero.name, 'component hero has new name').toBe(newName);
  expect(hdsSpy.testHero.name, 'service hero unchanged before save').toBe(origName);

  click(page.saveBtn);
  expect(hdsSpy.saveHero, 'saveHero called once').toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);

  await harness.fixture.whenStable();
  expect(hdsSpy.testHero.name, 'service hero has new name after save').toBe(newName);
  expect(TestBed.inject(Router).url).toEqual('/heroes');
});
```

### More overrides

The `TestBed.overrideComponent` method can be called multiple times for the same or different components.
The `TestBed` offers similar `overrideDirective`, `overrideModule`, and `overridePipe` methods for digging into and replacing parts of these other classes.

Explore the options and combinations on your own.
