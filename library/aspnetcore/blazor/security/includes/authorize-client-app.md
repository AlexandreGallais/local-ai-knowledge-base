# authorize-client-app

> **Important:**
> If you don't have the authority to grant admin consent to the tenant in the last step of **API permissions** configuration because consent to use the app is delegated to users, then you must take the following additional steps:
>
> * The app must use a trusted publisher domain.
> * In the **`Server`** app's configuration in the Azure portal, select **Expose an API**. Under **Authorized client applications**, select the button to **Add a client application**. Add the **`Client`** app's Application (client) ID (for example, `11112222-bbbb-3333-cccc-4444dddd5555`).
