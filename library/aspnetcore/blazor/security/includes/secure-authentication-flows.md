# secure-authentication-flows

> **Warning:**
> Don't store app secrets, connection strings, credentials, passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), private C#/.NET code, or private keys/tokens in client-side code, which is ***always insecure***. In test/staging and production environments, server-side Blazor code and web APIs should use secure authentication flows that avoid maintaining credentials within project code or configuration files. Outside of local development testing, we recommend avoiding the use of environment variables to store sensitive data, as environment variables aren't the most secure approach. For local development testing, the Secret Manager tool is recommended for securing sensitive data. For more information, see Securely maintain sensitive data and credentials.
