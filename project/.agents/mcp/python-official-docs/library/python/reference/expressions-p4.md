# Expressions (part 4 of 8)

### Yield expressions

```text
python-grammar
yield_atom: "(" `yield_expression` ")"
yield_from: "yield" "from" `expression`
yield_expression: "yield" `yield_list` | `yield_from`
```

The yield expression is used when defining a generator function
or an asynchronous generator function and
thus can only be used in the body of a function definition.  Using a yield
expression in a function's body causes that function to be a generator function,
and using it in an `async def` function's body causes that
coroutine function to be an asynchronous generator function. For example:

```
def gen():  # defines a generator function
    yield 123

async def agen(): # defines an asynchronous generator function
    yield 123
```

Due to their side effects on the containing scope, `yield` expressions
are not permitted as part of the implicitly defined scopes used to
implement comprehensions and generator expressions.

> *Changed in version 3.8.*
> Yield expressions prohibited in the implicitly nested scopes used to
> implement comprehensions and generator expressions.

Generator functions are described below, while asynchronous generator
functions are described separately in section
asynchronous-generator-functions.

When a generator function is called, it returns an iterator known as a
generator.  That generator then controls the execution of the generator
function.  The execution starts when one of the generator's methods is called.
At that time, the execution proceeds to the first yield expression, where it is
suspended again, returning the value of `python-grammar:yield_list`
to the generator's caller,
or `None` if `python-grammar:yield_list` is omitted.
By suspended, we mean that all local state is
retained, including the current bindings of local variables, the instruction
pointer, the internal evaluation stack, and the state of any exception handling.
When the execution is resumed by calling one of the generator's methods, the
function can proceed exactly as if the yield expression were just another
external call.  The value of the yield expression after resuming depends on the
method which resumed the execution.  If `__next__()` is used
(typically via either a `for` or the `next()` builtin) then the
result is `None`.  Otherwise, if `send()` is used, then
the result will be the value passed in to that method.

All of this makes generator functions quite similar to coroutines; they yield
multiple times, they have more than one entry point and their execution can be
suspended.  The only difference is that a generator function cannot control
where the execution should continue after it yields; the control is always
transferred to the generator's caller.

Yield expressions are allowed anywhere in a `try` construct.  If the
generator is not resumed before it is
finalized (by reaching a zero reference count or by being garbage collected),
the generator-iterator's `close()` method will be called,
allowing any pending `finally` clauses to execute.

When `yield from <expr>` is used, the supplied expression must be an
iterable. The values produced by iterating that iterable are passed directly
to the caller of the current generator's methods. Any values passed in with
`send()` and any exceptions passed in with
`throw()` are passed to the underlying iterator if it has the
appropriate methods.  If this is not the case, then `send()`
will raise `AttributeError` or `TypeError`, while
`throw()` will just raise the passed in exception immediately.

When the underlying iterator is complete, the `value`
attribute of the raised `StopIteration` instance becomes the value of
the yield expression. It can be either set explicitly when raising
`StopIteration`, or automatically when the subiterator is a generator
(by returning a value from the subgenerator).

> *Changed in version 3.3.*
> Added `yield from <expr>` to delegate control flow to a subiterator.

The parentheses may be omitted when the yield expression is the sole expression
on the right hand side of an assignment statement.

#### Examples

Here is a simple example that demonstrates the behavior of generators and
generator functions:

```
>>> def echo(value=None):
...     print("Execution starts when 'next()' is called for the first time.")
...     try:
...         while True:
...             try:
...                 value = (yield value)
...             except Exception as e:
...                 value = e
...     finally:
...         print("Don't forget to clean up when 'close()' is called.")
...
>>> generator = echo(1)
>>> print(next(generator))
Execution starts when 'next()' is called for the first time.
1
>>> print(next(generator))
None
>>> print(generator.send(2))
2
>>> generator.throw(TypeError, "spam")
TypeError('spam',)
>>> generator.close()
Don't forget to clean up when 'close()' is called.
```

For examples using `yield from`, see pep-380 in "What's New in
Python."

#### Asynchronous generator functions

The presence of a yield expression in a function or method defined using
`async def` further defines the function as an
asynchronous generator function.

When an asynchronous generator function is called, it returns an
asynchronous iterator known as an asynchronous generator object.
That object then controls the execution of the generator function.
An asynchronous generator object is typically used in an
`async for` statement in a coroutine function analogously to
how a generator object would be used in a `for` statement.

Calling one of the asynchronous generator's methods returns an awaitable
object, and the execution starts when this object is awaited on. At that time,
the execution proceeds to the first yield expression, where it is suspended
again, returning the value of `python-grammar:yield_list` to the
awaiting coroutine. As with a generator, suspension means that all local state
is retained, including the current bindings of local variables, the instruction
pointer, the internal evaluation stack, and the state of any exception handling.
When the execution is resumed by awaiting on the next object returned by the
asynchronous generator's methods, the function can proceed exactly as if the
yield expression were just another external call. The value of the yield
expression after resuming depends on the method which resumed the execution.  If
`__anext__()` is used then the result is `None`. Otherwise, if
`asend()` is used, then the result will be the value passed in to that
method.

If an asynchronous generator happens to exit early by `break`, the caller
task being cancelled, or other exceptions, the generator's async cleanup code
will run and possibly raise exceptions or access context variables in an
unexpected context--perhaps after the lifetime of tasks it depends, or
during the event loop shutdown when the async-generator garbage collection hook
is called.
To prevent this, the caller must explicitly close the async generator by calling
`aclose()` method to finalize the generator and ultimately detach it
from the event loop.

In an asynchronous generator function, yield expressions are allowed anywhere
in a `try` construct. However, if an asynchronous generator is not
resumed before it is finalized (by reaching a zero reference count or by
being garbage collected), then a yield expression within a `try`
construct could result in a failure to execute pending `finally`
clauses.  In this case, it is the responsibility of the event loop or
scheduler running the asynchronous generator to call the asynchronous
generator-iterator's `aclose()` method and run the resulting
coroutine object, thus allowing any pending `finally` clauses
to execute.

To take care of finalization upon event loop termination, an event loop should
define a *finalizer* function which takes an asynchronous generator-iterator and
presumably calls `aclose()` and executes the coroutine.
This  *finalizer* may be registered by calling `sys.set_asyncgen_hooks()`.
When first iterated over, an asynchronous generator-iterator will store the
registered *finalizer* to be called upon finalization. For a reference example
of a *finalizer* method see the implementation of
`asyncio.Loop.shutdown_asyncgens` in Lib/asyncio/base_events.py.

The expression `yield from <expr>` is a syntax error when used in an
asynchronous generator function.
