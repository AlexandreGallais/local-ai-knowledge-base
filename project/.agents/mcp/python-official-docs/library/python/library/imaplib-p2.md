# imaplib --- IMAP4 protocol client (part 2 of 3)

## IMAP4 Objects

All IMAP4rev1 commands are represented by methods of the same name, either
uppercase or lowercase.

All arguments to commands are converted to strings, except for `AUTHENTICATE`,
and the last argument to `APPEND` which is passed as an IMAP4 literal.  If
necessary (the string contains IMAP4 protocol-sensitive characters and isn't
enclosed with either parentheses or double quotes) each string is quoted.
However, the *password* argument to the `LOGIN` command is always quoted. If
you want to avoid having an argument string quoted (eg: the *flags* argument to
`STORE`) then enclose the string in parentheses (eg: `r'(\Deleted)'`).
In general, pass <example-value> unquoted and let the module quote them as needed.
An argument that is already enclosed in double quotes is left unchanged,
so that code which quotes arguments itself keeps working.

Most commands return a tuple: `(type, [data, ...])` where *type* is usually
`'OK'` or `'NO'`, and *data* is either the text from the command response,
or mandated results from the command. Each *data* is either a `bytes`, or a
tuple. If a tuple, then the first part is the header of the response, and the
second part contains the data (ie: 'literal' value).

The *message_set* options to commands below is a string specifying one or more
messages to be acted upon.  It may be a simple message number (`'1'`), a range
of message numbers (`'2:4'`), or a group of non-contiguous ranges separated by
commas (`'1:3,6:9'`).  A range can contain an asterisk to indicate an infinite
upper bound (`'3:*'`).

An `IMAP4` instance has the following methods:

### `IMAP4.append(mailbox, flags, date_time, message)`

Append *message* to named mailbox.

*flags* may be `None` or a string of IMAP flag tokens.  Multiple
flags are separated by spaces, for example `r'\Seen \Answered'`.
If *flags* is not already enclosed in parentheses, parentheses are
added automatically.

### `IMAP4.authenticate(mechanism, authobject)`

Authenticate command --- requires response processing.

*mechanism* specifies which authentication mechanism is to be used - it should
appear in the instance variable `capabilities` in the form `AUTH=mechanism`.

*authobject* must be a callable object:

```
data = authobject(response)
```

It will be called to process server continuation responses; the *response*
argument it is passed will be `bytes`.  It should return `bytes` *data*
that will be base64 encoded and sent to the server.  It should return
`None` if the client abort response `*` should be sent instead.

> *Changed in version 3.5.*
> string usernames and passwords are now encoded to `utf-8` instead of
> being limited to ASCII.

### `IMAP4.check()`

Checkpoint mailbox on server.

### `IMAP4.close()`

Close currently selected mailbox. Deleted messages are removed from writable
mailbox. This is the recommended command before `LOGOUT`.

### `IMAP4.copy(message_set, new_mailbox)`

Copy *message_set* messages onto end of *new_mailbox*.

### `IMAP4.create(mailbox)`

Create new mailbox named *mailbox*.

### `IMAP4.delete(mailbox)`

Delete old mailbox named *mailbox*.

### `IMAP4.deleteacl(mailbox, who)`

Delete the ACLs (remove any rights) set for who on mailbox.

### `IMAP4.enable(capability)`

Enable *capability* (see RFC 5161).  Most capabilities do not need to be
enabled.  Currently only the `UTF8=ACCEPT` capability is supported
(see 6855).

> *Added in version 3.5.*
> The `enable()` method itself, and 6855 support.

### `IMAP4.expunge()`

Permanently remove deleted items from selected mailbox. Generates an `EXPUNGE`
response for each deleted message. Returned data contains a list of `EXPUNGE`
message numbers in order received.

### `IMAP4.fetch(message_set, message_parts)`

Fetch (parts of) messages.  *message_parts* should be a string of message part
names enclosed within parentheses, eg: `"(UID BODY[TEXT])"`.  Returned data
are tuples of message part envelope and data.

### `IMAP4.getacl(mailbox)`

Get the `ACL`s for *mailbox*. The method is non-standard, but is supported
by the `Cyrus` server.

### `IMAP4.getannotation(mailbox, entry, attribute)`

Retrieve the specified `ANNOTATION`s for *mailbox*. The method is
non-standard, but is supported by the `Cyrus` server.

### `IMAP4.getquota(root)`

Get the `quota` *root*'s resource usage and limits. This method is part of the
IMAP4 QUOTA extension defined in rfc2087.

### `IMAP4.getquotaroot(mailbox)`

Get the list of `quota` `roots` for the named *mailbox*. This method is part
of the IMAP4 QUOTA extension defined in rfc2087.

### `IMAP4.idle(duration=None)`

Return an `Idler`: an iterable context manager implementing the
IMAP4 `IDLE` command as defined in RFC 2177.

The returned object sends the `IDLE` command when activated by the
`with` statement, produces IMAP untagged responses via the
iterator protocol, and sends `DONE` upon context exit.

All untagged responses that arrive after sending the `IDLE` command
(including any that arrive before the server acknowledges the command) will
be available via iteration. Any leftover responses (those not iterated in
the `with` context) can be retrieved in the usual way after
`IDLE` ends, using `IMAP4.response()`.

Responses are represented as `(type, [data, ...])` tuples, as described
in IMAP4 Objects.

The *duration* argument sets a maximum duration (in seconds) to keep idling,
after which any ongoing iteration will stop. It can be an `int` or
`float`, or `None` for no time limit.
Callers wishing to avoid inactivity timeouts on servers that impose them
should keep this at most 29 minutes (1740 seconds).
Requires a socket connection; *duration* must be `None` on
`IMAP4_stream` connections.

```pycon
>>> with M.idle(duration=29 * 60) as idler:
...     for typ, data in idler:
...         print(typ, data)
...
EXISTS [b'1']
RECENT [b'1']
```

### `Idler.burst(interval=0.1)`

Yield a burst of responses no more than *interval* seconds apart
(expressed as an `int` or `float`).

This generator is an alternative to iterating one response at a
time, intended to aid in efficient batch processing. It retrieves the
next response along with any immediately available subsequent responses.
(For example, a rapid series of `EXPUNGE` responses after a bulk
delete.)

Requires a socket connection; does not work on `IMAP4_stream`
connections.

```pycon
>>> with M.idle() as idler:
...     # get a response and any others following by < 0.1 seconds
...     batch = list(idler.burst())
...     print(f'processing {len(batch)} responses...')
...     print(batch)
...
processing 3 responses...
[('EXPUNGE', [b'2']), ('EXPUNGE', [b'1']), ('RECENT', [b'0'])]
```

> **Tip:** The `IDLE` context's maximum duration, as passed to
> `IMAP4.idle()`, is respected when waiting for the first response
> in a burst. Therefore, an expired `Idler` will cause this
> generator to return immediately without producing anything. Callers
> should consider this if using it in a loop.

> **Note:** The iterator returned by `IMAP4.idle()` is usable only within a
> `with` statement. Before or after that context, unsolicited
> responses are collected internally whenever a command finishes, and can
> be retrieved with `IMAP4.response()`.

> **Note:** The `Idler` class name and structure are internal interfaces,
> subject to change. Calling code can rely on its context management,
> iteration, and public method to remain stable, but should not subclass,
> instantiate, compare, or otherwise directly reference the class.

> *Added in version 3.14.*

### `IMAP4.list(directory='', pattern='*')`

List mailbox names in *directory* matching *pattern*.  *directory* defaults to
the top-level mail folder, and *pattern* defaults to match anything.  Returned
data contains a list of `LIST` responses.

### `IMAP4.login(user, password)`

Identify the client using a plaintext password. The *password* will be quoted.

### `IMAP4.login_cram_md5(user, password)`

Force use of `CRAM-MD5` authentication when identifying the client to protect
the password.  Will only work if the server `CAPABILITY` response includes the
phrase `AUTH=CRAM-MD5`.

> *Changed in version 3.15.*
> An `IMAP4.error` is raised if MD5 support is not available.

### `IMAP4.logout()`

Shutdown connection to server. Returns server `BYE` response.

> *Changed in version 3.8.*
> The method no longer ignores silently arbitrary exceptions.

### `IMAP4.lsub(directory='', pattern='*')`

List subscribed mailbox names in directory matching pattern. *directory*
defaults to the top level directory and *pattern* defaults to match any mailbox.
Returned data are tuples of message part envelope and data.

### `IMAP4.myrights(mailbox)`

Show my ACLs for a mailbox (i.e. the rights that I have on mailbox).

### `IMAP4.namespace()`

Returns IMAP namespaces as defined in RFC 2342.

### `IMAP4.noop()`

Send `NOOP` to server.

### `IMAP4.open(host, port, timeout=None)`

Opens socket to *port* at *host*. The optional *timeout* parameter
specifies a timeout in seconds for the connection attempt.
If timeout is not given or is `None`, the global default socket timeout
is used. Also note that if the *timeout* parameter is set to be zero,
it will raise a `ValueError` to reject creating a non-blocking socket.
This method is implicitly called by the `IMAP4` constructor.
The connection objects established by this method will be used in
the `IMAP4.read()`, `IMAP4.readline()`, `IMAP4.send()`,
and `IMAP4.shutdown()` methods. You may override this method.

> *Changed in version 3.9.*
> The *timeout* parameter was added.

### `IMAP4.partial(message_num, message_part, start, length)`

Fetch truncated part of a message. Returned data is a tuple of message part
envelope and data.

### `IMAP4.proxyauth(user)`

Assume authentication as *user*. Allows an authorised administrator to proxy
into any user's mailbox.

### `IMAP4.read(size)`

Reads *size* bytes from the remote server. You may override this method.

### `IMAP4.readline()`

Reads one line from the remote server. You may override this method.

### `IMAP4.recent()`

Prompt server for an update. Returned data is `None` if no new messages, else
value of `RECENT` response.

### `IMAP4.rename(oldmailbox, newmailbox)`

Rename mailbox named *oldmailbox* to *newmailbox*.

### `IMAP4.response(code)`

Return data for response *code* if received, or `None`. Returns the given
code, instead of the usual type.

### `IMAP4.search(charset, criterion[, ...])`

Search mailbox for matching messages.  *charset* may be `None`, in which case
no `CHARSET` will be specified in the request to the server.  The IMAP
protocol requires that at least one criterion be specified; an exception will be
raised when the server returns an error.  *charset* must be `None` if
the `UTF8=ACCEPT` capability was enabled using the `enable()`
command.

Example:

```
# M is a connected IMAP4 instance...
typ, msgnums = M.search(None, 'FROM', '"LDJ"')

# or:
typ, msgnums = M.search(None, '(FROM "LDJ")')
```

### `IMAP4.select(mailbox='INBOX', readonly=False)`

Select a mailbox. Returned data is the count of messages in *mailbox*
(`EXISTS` response).  The default *mailbox* is `'INBOX'`.  If the *readonly*
flag is set, modifications to the mailbox are not allowed.

### `IMAP4.send(data)`

Sends `data` to the remote server. You may override this method.

### `IMAP4.setacl(mailbox, who, what)`

Set an `ACL` for *mailbox*. The method is non-standard, but is supported by
the `Cyrus` server.

### `IMAP4.setannotation(mailbox, entry, attribute[, ...])`

Set `ANNOTATION`s for *mailbox*. The method is non-standard, but is
supported by the `Cyrus` server.

### `IMAP4.setquota(root, limits)`

Set the `quota` *root*'s resource *limits*. This method is part of the IMAP4
QUOTA extension defined in rfc2087.

### `IMAP4.shutdown()`

Close connection established in `open`.  This method is implicitly
called by `IMAP4.logout()`.  You may override this method.

### `IMAP4.socket()`

Returns socket instance used to connect to server.

### `IMAP4.sort(sort_criteria, charset, search_criterion[, ...])`

The `sort` command is a variant of `search` with sorting semantics for the
results.  Returned data contains a space separated list of matching message
numbers.

Sort has two arguments before the *search_criterion* argument(s); a
parenthesized list of *sort_criteria*, and the searching *charset*.  Note that
unlike `search`, the searching *charset* argument is mandatory.  There is also
a `uid sort` command which corresponds to `sort` the way that `uid search`
corresponds to `search`.  The `sort` command first searches the mailbox for
messages that match the given searching criteria using the charset argument for
the interpretation of strings in the searching criteria.  It then returns the
numbers of matching messages.

This is an `IMAP4rev1` extension command.

### `IMAP4.starttls(ssl_context=None)`

Send a `STARTTLS` command.  The *ssl_context* argument is optional
and should be a `ssl.SSLContext` object.  This will enable
encryption on the IMAP connection.  Please read ssl-security for
best practices.

> **Note:** With the default *ssl_context*, the connection is encrypted but the
> server certificate and hostname are not verified.
> To verify them, pass a context created by
> `ssl.create_default_context()`.

> *Added in version 3.2.*

> *Changed in version 3.4.*
> The method now supports hostname check with
> `ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname` and *Server Name Indication* (see
> `ssl.HAS_SNI`).

### `IMAP4.status(mailbox, names)`

Request named status conditions for *mailbox*.

### `IMAP4.store(message_set, command, flag_list)`

Alters flag dispositions for messages in mailbox.  *command* is specified by
section 6.4.6 of RFC 3501 as being one of "FLAGS", "+FLAGS", or "-FLAGS",
optionally with a suffix of ".SILENT".

For example, to set the delete flag on all messages:

```
typ, data = M.search(None, 'ALL')
for num in data[0].split():
   M.store(num, '+FLAGS', '\\Deleted')
M.expunge()
```

> **Note:** Creating flags containing ']' (for example: "[test]") violates
> RFC 3501 (the IMAP protocol).  However, imaplib has historically
> allowed creation of such flags, and popular IMAP servers, such as Gmail,
> accept and produce such flags.  There are non-Python programs which also
> create such flags.  Although it is an RFC violation and IMAP clients and
> servers are supposed to be strict, imaplib still continues to allow
> such flags to be created for backward compatibility reasons, and as of
> Python 3.6, handles them if they are sent from the server, since this
> improves real-world compatibility.

### `IMAP4.subscribe(mailbox)`

Subscribe to new mailbox.
