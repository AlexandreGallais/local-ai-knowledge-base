# `tokenize` --- Tokenizer for Python source

Module `tokenize`.

**Source code:** Lib/tokenize.py

The `tokenize` module provides a lexical scanner for Python source code,
implemented in Python.  The scanner in this module returns comments as tokens
as well, making it useful for implementing "pretty-printers", including
colorizers for on-screen displays.

To simplify token <example-value> handling, all operator and
delimiter tokens and `Ellipsis` are returned using
the generic `OP` token type.
The `TokenInfo.exact_type` property gives the exact token type.

> **Warning:** Note that the functions in this module are only designed to parse
> syntactically valid Python code (code that does not raise when parsed
> using `ast.parse()`).  The behavior of the functions in this module is
> **undefined** when providing invalid Python code and it can change at any
> point.

## Tokenizing input

The primary entry point is a generator:

### `tokenize(readline)`

The `.tokenize()` generator requires one argument, *readline*, which
must be a callable object which provides the same interface as the
`io.IOBase.readline()` method of file objects.  Each call to the
function should return one line of input as bytes.

The generator produces `TokenInfo` objects.

> *Changed in version 3.1.*
> Changed to yield `TokenInfo` objects instead of plain tuples.

`.tokenize()` determines the source encoding of the file by looking for a
UTF-8 BOM or encoding cookie, according to PEP 263.

### `generate_tokens(readline)`

Tokenize a source reading unicode strings instead of bytes.

Like `.tokenize()`, the *readline* argument is a callable returning
a single line of input. However, `generate_tokens()` expects *readline*
to return a str object rather than bytes.

The result is an iterator yielding `TokenInfo` objects, exactly like
`.tokenize()`. It does not yield an `ENCODING` token.

### class `TokenInfo(type, string, start, end, line)`

A named tuple describing a token. It has five fields and an
additional `exact_type` property.

> *Added in version 3.1.*

### `type`

An integer identifying the token type, as defined by the constants in
`token`, such as `NAME` and `STRING`.
Operators and delimiters have type `OP`; use
`exact_type` for their specific token type.

### `string`

The token text as a `str`.
For `STRING` tokens, this includes the quotes, any prefix,
and escape sequences, without evaluating them.

For an `ENCODING` token, this is the encoding name.
Tokens inserted without corresponding source text can have an empty
string. In `FSTRING_MIDDLE` and
`TSTRING_MIDDLE` tokens, doubled braces are replaced by
single braces.

### `start`

A 2-tuple `(srow, scol)` of ints specifying the inclusive start
position of the token in the source. Rows are numbered from 1 and
columns from 0. Columns count Unicode code points; a tab counts as
one column, without expanding it to a tab stop.

For an `ENCODING` token, this is `(0, 0)`.

### `end`

A 2-tuple `(erow, ecol)` of ints specifying the exclusive end
position of the token. Rows are numbered from 1 and columns from 0.
For a token <example-value> multiple lines, *erow* is the final row and
*ecol* is the column on that row.

For example, the name `spam` at the beginning of the first line
has `start` equal to `(1, 0)` and `end` equal to `(1, 4)`.

For an `ENCODING` token, this is `(0, 0)`.
A `NEWLINE` or `NL` token <example-value> at the end
of input without a final newline can have an end column one beyond
the source text.

### `line`

A `str` containing the full source line on which
the token was found, including surrounding text and the line terminator
if present. For a token <example-value> multiple lines, this can contain
several source lines. It is empty for `ENCODING` and
`ENDMARKER` tokens.

### `exact_type`

An integer identifying the specific operator type for
`OP` tokens, as defined by the constants in `token`.
For all other token types, this equals `type`.
For example, a `+` token has `type` equal to `OP`
and `exact_type` equal to `PLUS`.

> *Added in version 3.3.*

All constants from the `token` module are also exported from
`tokenize`.

Another function is provided to reverse the tokenization process. This is
useful for creating tools that tokenize a script, modify the token <example-value>, and
write back the modified script.

### `untokenize(iterable)`

Converts tokens back into Python source code.  The *iterable* must return
sequences with at least two elements, the token type and the token string.
Any additional sequence elements are ignored.

The result is guaranteed to tokenize back to match the input so that the
conversion is lossless and round-trips are assured.  The guarantee applies
only to the token type and token <example-value> as the spacing between tokens
(column positions) may change.

It returns bytes, encoded using the `ENCODING` token, which
is the first token <example-value> output by `.tokenize()`. If there is no
encoding token in the input, it returns a str instead.

`.tokenize()` needs to detect the encoding of source files it tokenizes. The
function it uses to do this is available:

### `detect_encoding(readline)`

The `detect_encoding()` function is used to detect the encoding that
should be used to decode a Python source file. It requires one argument,
readline, in the same way as the `.tokenize()` generator.

It will call readline a maximum of twice, and return the encoding used
(as a string) and a list of any lines (not decoded from bytes) it has read
in.

It detects the encoding from the presence of a UTF-8 BOM or an encoding
cookie as specified in PEP 263. If both a BOM and a cookie are present,
but disagree, a `SyntaxError` will be raised. Note that if the BOM is found,
`'utf-8-sig'` will be returned as an encoding.

If no encoding is specified, then the default of `'utf-8'` will be
returned.

Use `.open()` to open Python source files: it uses
`detect_encoding()` to detect the file encoding.

### `open(filename)`

Open a file in read only mode using the encoding detected by
`detect_encoding()`.

> *Added in version 3.2.*

### exception `TokenError`

Raised when either a docstring or expression that may be split over several
lines is not completed anywhere in the file, for example:

```
"""Beginning of
docstring
```

or:

```
[1,
 2,
 3
```

## Command-line usage

> *Added in version 3.3.*

The `tokenize` module can be executed as a script from the command line.
It is as simple as:

```sh
python -m tokenize [-e] [filename.py]
```

The following options are accepted:

tokenize

### option `-h, --help`

show this help message and exit

### option `-e, --exact`

display token names using the exact type

If `filename.py` is specified its contents are tokenized to stdout.
Otherwise, tokenization is performed on stdin.

> *Added in version 3.15.*
> Output is in color by default and can be
> controlled using environment variables.

## Examples

Example of a script rewriter that transforms float literals into Decimal
objects:

```
from tokenize import tokenize, untokenize, NUMBER, STRING, NAME, OP
from io import BytesIO

def decistmt(s):
    """Substitute Decimals for floats in a string of statements.

    >>> from decimal import Decimal
    >>> s = 'print(+21.3e-5*-.1234/81.7)'
    >>> decistmt(s)
    "print (+Decimal ('21.3e-5')*-Decimal ('.1234')/Decimal ('81.7'))"

    The format of the exponent is inherited from the platform C library.
    Known cases are "e-007" (Windows) and "e-07" (not Windows).  Since
    we're only showing 12 digits, and the 13th isn't close to 5, the
    rest of the output should be platform-independent.

    >>> exec(s)  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    -3.21716034272e-0...7

    Output from calculations with Decimal should be identical across all
    platforms.

    >>> exec(decistmt(s))
    -3.217160342717258261933904529E-7
    """
    result = []
    g = tokenize(BytesIO(s.encode('<example-value>')).readline)  # tokenize the string
    for toknum, tokval, _, _, _ in g:
        if toknum == NUMBER and '<example-value>' in tokval:  # replace NUMBER tokens
            result.extend([
                (NAME, 'Decimal'),
                (OP, '('),
                (STRING, repr(tokval)),
                (OP, ')')
            ])
        else:
            result.append((toknum, tokval))
    return untokenize(result).decode('<example-value>')
```

Example of tokenizing from the command line.  The script:

```
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, World!")

say_hello()
```

will be tokenized to the following output where the first column is the range
of the line/column coordinates where the token is found, the second column is
the name of the token, and the final column is the value of the token (if any):

```shell-session
$ python -m tokenize hello.py
0,0-0,0:            ENCODING       'utf-8'
1,0-1,3:            NAME           'def'
1,4-1,13:           NAME           'say_hello'
1,13-1,14:          OP             '('
1,14-1,15:          OP             ')'
1,15-1,16:          OP             ':'
1,16-1,17:          NEWLINE        '\n'
2,0-2,4:            INDENT         '    '
2,4-2,9:            NAME           'print'
2,9-2,10:           OP             '('
2,10-2,25:          STRING         '"Hello, World!"'
2,25-2,26:          OP             ')'
2,26-2,27:          NEWLINE        '\n'
3,0-3,1:            NL             '\n'
4,0-4,0:            DEDENT         ''
4,0-4,9:            NAME           'say_hello'
4,9-4,10:           OP             '('
4,10-4,11:          OP             ')'
4,11-4,12:          NEWLINE        '\n'
5,0-5,0:            ENDMARKER      ''
```

The exact token type names can be displayed using the `-e` option:

```shell-session
$ python -m tokenize -e hello.py
0,0-0,0:            ENCODING       'utf-8'
1,0-1,3:            NAME           'def'
1,4-1,13:           NAME           'say_hello'
1,13-1,14:          LPAR           '('
1,14-1,15:          RPAR           ')'
1,15-1,16:          COLON          ':'
1,16-1,17:          NEWLINE        '\n'
2,0-2,4:            INDENT         '    '
2,4-2,9:            NAME           'print'
2,9-2,10:           LPAR           '('
2,10-2,25:          STRING         '"Hello, World!"'
2,25-2,26:          RPAR           ')'
2,26-2,27:          NEWLINE        '\n'
3,0-3,1:            NL             '\n'
4,0-4,0:            DEDENT         ''
4,0-4,9:            NAME           'say_hello'
4,9-4,10:           LPAR           '('
4,10-4,11:          RPAR           ')'
4,11-4,12:          NEWLINE        '\n'
5,0-5,0:            ENDMARKER      ''
```

Example of tokenizing a file programmatically, reading unicode
strings instead of bytes with `generate_tokens()`:

```
import tokenize

with tokenize.open('<example-value>') as f:
    tokens = tokenize.generate_tokens(f.readline)
    for token in tokens:
        print(token)
```

Or reading bytes directly with `.tokenize()`:

```
import tokenize

with open('hello.py', 'rb') as f:
    tokens = tokenize.tokenize(f.readline)
    for token in tokens:
        print(token)
```
