# `dbm` --- Interfaces to Unix "databases"

Module `dbm`.

**Source code:** Lib/dbm/__init__.py

`dbm` is a generic interface to variants of the DBM database:

- `dbm.sqlite3`
- `dbm.gnu`
- `dbm.ndbm`

If none of these modules are installed, the
slow-but-simple implementation in module `dbm.dumb` will be used. There
is a third party interface to
the Oracle Berkeley DB.

> **Note:** None of the underlying modules will automatically shrink the disk space used by
> the database file. However, `dbm.sqlite3`, `dbm.gnu` and `dbm.dumb`
> provide a `reorganize()` method that can be used for this purpose.

### exception `error`

A tuple containing the exceptions that can be raised by each of the supported
modules, with a unique exception also named `dbm.error` as the first
item --- the latter is used when `dbm.error` is raised.

### `whichdb(filename)`

This function attempts to guess which of the several simple database modules
available --- `dbm.sqlite3`, `dbm.gnu`, `dbm.ndbm`,
or `dbm.dumb` --- should be used to open a given file.

Return one of the following values:

- `None` if the file can't be opened because it's unreadable or doesn't exist
- the empty string (`''`) if the file's format can't be guessed
- a string containing the required module name, such as `'dbm.ndbm'` or `'dbm.gnu'`

> *Changed in version 3.11.*
> *filename* accepts a path-like object.

### `open(file, flag='r', mode=0o666)`

Open a database and return the corresponding database object.

- **param `file`:**
The database file to open.

If the database file already exists, the `whichdb()` function is used to
determine its type and the appropriate module is used; if it does not exist,
the first submodule listed above that can be imported is used.
- **type `file`:** path-like object

- **param `str flag`:**
- `'r'` (default): flag_r
- `'w'`: flag_w
- `'c'`: flag_c
- `'n'`: flag_n

- **param `int mode`:**
mode_param_doc

> *Changed in version 3.11.*
> *file* accepts a path-like object.

The object returned by `open()` supports the basic
functionality of mutable mappings;
keys and their corresponding values can be stored, retrieved, and
deleted, and iteration, the `in` operator and methods `keys()`,
`get()`, `setdefault()` and `clear()` are available.
The `keys()` method returns a list instead of a view object.
The `setdefault()` method requires two arguments.

Key and values are always stored as `bytes`. This means that when
strings are used they are implicitly converted to the default encoding before
being stored. For detailed information about accepted types, see
dbm-key-value-types.

These objects also support being used in a `with` statement, which
will automatically close them when done.

> *Changed in version 3.2.*
> `get()` and `setdefault()` methods are now available for all
> `dbm` backends.

> *Changed in version 3.4.*
> Added native support for the context management protocol to the objects
> returned by `open()`.

> *Changed in version 3.8.*
> Deleting a key from a read-only database raises a database module specific exception
> instead of `KeyError`.

> *Changed in version 3.13.*
> `clear()` methods are now available for all `dbm` backends.

## Key and value types

The accepted types for keys and values vary by backend. Keys and values are
handled the same way, except where noted below:

- **Traditional backends:**

- `dbm.gnu` and `dbm.ndbm`: Accept `str` and `bytes`
objects.
- `dbm.dumb`: Accepts `str` and `bytes` objects;
`bytearray` is acceptable as a value, but not as a key.

- **SQLite backend** (`dbm.sqlite3`): Accepts `str`, `bytes`,
`int`, `float`, `bool`, `bytearray`,
`memoryview`, and `array.array` objects.

**Storage format:**

All keys and values are stored as `bytes` objects in the database.
When retrieving, you'll always get bytes back, regardless of the original
type stored.

**Type conversion examples:**

- `db['key'] = 'string'` stored as `b'string'`
- `db['key'] = bytearray(b'data')` stored as `b'data'`
(`dbm.dumb` and `dbm.sqlite3` only)
- `db['key'] = 42` stored as `b'42'` (`dbm.sqlite3` only)
- `db['key'] = 3.14` stored as `b'3.14'` (`dbm.sqlite3` only)
- `db['key'] = True` stored as `b'1'` (`dbm.sqlite3` only)
- `db['key'] = False` stored as `b'0'` (`dbm.sqlite3` only)
- `db['key'] = memoryview(b'data')` stored as `b'data'`
(`dbm.sqlite3` only)
- `db['key'] = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3])` stored as bytes (for example, on
little-endian: `b'\x01\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x03\x00\x00\x00'`)
(`dbm.sqlite3` only)

The following example records some hostnames and a corresponding title,  and
then prints out the contents of the database:

```
import dbm

# Open database, creating it if necessary.
with dbm.open('cache', 'c') as db:

    # Record some values
    db[b'hello'] = b'there'
    db['www.python.org'] = 'Python Website'
    db['www.cnn.com'] = 'Cable News Network'

    # Note that the keys are considered bytes now.
    assert db[b'www.python.org'] == b'Python Website'
    # Notice how the value is now in bytes.
    assert db['www.cnn.com'] == b'Cable News Network'

    # Often-used methods of the dict interface work too.
    print(db.get('python.org', b'not present'))

    # Storing a non-string key or value behavior depends on the backend:
    # - Traditional backends (ndbm, gnu, dumb) will raise a TypeError
    # - The sqlite3 backend accepts it and converts to bytes
    db['www.yahoo.com'] = 4

# db is automatically closed when leaving the with statement.
```

> **See also:** Module `shelve`
> Persistence module which stores non-string data.

The individual submodules are described in the following sections.

## `dbm.sqlite3` --- SQLite backend for dbm

Module `dbm.sqlite3`.

> *Added in version 3.13.*

**Source code:** Lib/dbm/sqlite3.py

This module uses the standard library `sqlite3` module to provide an
SQLite backend for the `dbm` module.
The files created by `dbm.sqlite3` can thus be opened by `sqlite3`,
or any other SQLite browser, including the SQLite CLI.

### `open(filename, /, flag="r", mode=0o666)`

Open an SQLite database.

- **param `filename`:**
The path to the database to be opened.
- **type `filename`:** path-like object

- **param `str flag`:**

- `'r'` (default): flag_r
- `'w'`: flag_w
- `'c'`: flag_c
- `'n'`: flag_n

- **param `mode`:**
The Unix file access mode of the file (default: octal `0o666`),
used only when the database has to be created.

The returned database object behaves similar to a mutable mapping,
but the `keys()` method returns a list, and
the `setdefault()` method requires two arguments.
It also supports a "closing" context manager via the `with` keyword.

The following methods are also provided:

### `sqlite3.close()`

Close the SQLite database.

### `sqlite3.reorganize()`

If you have carried out a lot of deletions and would like to shrink the space
used on disk, this method will reorganize the database; otherwise, deleted file
space will be kept and reused as new (key, value) pairs are added.

> **Note:** While reorganizing, as much as two times the size of the original database is required
> in free disk space. However, be aware that this factor changes for each `dbm` submodule.

> *Added in version 3.15.*

## `dbm.gnu` --- GNU database manager

Module `dbm.gnu`.

**Source code:** Lib/dbm/gnu.py

The `dbm.gnu` module provides an interface to the GDBM (GNU dbm)
library, similar to the `dbm.ndbm` module, but with additional
functionality like crash tolerance.

> **Note:** The file formats created by `dbm.gnu` and `dbm.ndbm` are incompatible
> and can not be used interchangeably.

> **Availability:** Unix.

### exception `error`

Raised on `dbm.gnu`-specific errors, such as I/O errors. `KeyError` is
raised for general mapping errors like specifying an incorrect key.

### `open_flags`

A string of characters the *flag* parameter of `open()` supports.

### `open(filename, flag="r", mode=0o666, /)`

Open a GDBM database and return a `gdbm` object.

- **param `filename`:**
The database file to open.
- **type `filename`:** path-like object

- **param `str flag`:**
- `'r'` (default): flag_r
- `'w'`: flag_w
- `'c'`: flag_c
- `'n'`: flag_n

The following additional characters may be appended
to control how the database is opened:

- `'f'`: Open the database in fast mode.
Writes to the database will not be synchronized.
- `'s'`: Synchronized mode.
Changes to the database will be written immediately to the file.
- `'u'`: Do not lock database.

Not all flags are valid for all versions of GDBM.
See the `open_flags` member for a list of supported flag characters.

- **param `int mode`:**
mode_param_doc

- **raises `error`:**
If an invalid *flag* argument is passed.

> *Changed in version 3.11.*
> *filename* accepts a path-like object.

`gdbm` objects behave similar to mutable mappings,
but methods `items()`, `values()`, `pop()`, `popitem()`,
and `update()` are not supported,
the `keys()` method returns a list, and
the `setdefault()` method requires two arguments.
It also supports a "closing" context manager via the `with` keyword.

> *Changed in version 3.2.*
> Added the `get()` and `setdefault()` methods.

> *Changed in version 3.13.*
> Added the `clear()` method.

The following methods are also provided:

### `gdbm.close()`

Close the GDBM database.

### `gdbm.firstkey()`

It's possible to loop over every key in the database using this method  and the
`nextkey()` method.  The traversal is ordered by GDBM's internal
hash values, and won't be sorted by the key values.  This method returns
the starting key.

### `gdbm.nextkey(key)`

Returns the key that follows *key* in the traversal.  The following code prints
every key in the database `db`, without having to create a list in memory that
contains them all:

```
k = db.firstkey()
while k is not None:
    print(k)
    k = db.nextkey(k)
```

### `gdbm.reorganize()`

If you have carried out a lot of deletions and would like to shrink the space
used by the GDBM file, this routine will reorganize the database.  `gdbm`
objects will not shorten the length of a database file except by using this
reorganization; otherwise, deleted file space will be kept and reused as new
(key, value) pairs are added.

> **Note:** While reorganizing, as much as one time the size of the original database is required
> in free disk space. However, be aware that this factor changes for each `dbm` submodule.

### `gdbm.sync()`

When the database has been opened in fast mode, this method forces any
unwritten data to be written to the disk.

## `dbm.ndbm` --- New Database Manager

Module `dbm.ndbm`.

**Source code:** Lib/dbm/ndbm.py

The `dbm.ndbm` module provides an interface to the
NDBM (New Database Manager) library.
This module can be used with the "classic" NDBM interface or the
GDBM (GNU dbm) compatibility interface.

> **Note:** The file formats created by `dbm.gnu` and `dbm.ndbm` are incompatible
> and can not be used interchangeably.

> **Warning:** The NDBM library shipped as part of macOS has an undocumented limitation on the
> size of values, which can result in corrupted database files
> when storing values larger than this limit. Reading such corrupted files can
> result in a hard crash (segmentation fault).

> **Availability:** Unix.

### exception `error`

Raised on `dbm.ndbm`-specific errors, such as I/O errors. `KeyError` is raised
for general mapping errors like specifying an incorrect key.

### `library`

Name of the NDBM implementation library used.

### `open(filename, flag="r", mode=0o666, /)`

Open an NDBM database and return an `ndbm` object.

- **param `filename`:**
The basename of the database file
(without the `.dir` or `.pag` extensions).
- **type `filename`:** path-like object

- **param `str flag`:**
- `'r'` (default): flag_r
- `'w'`: flag_w
- `'c'`: flag_c
- `'n'`: flag_n

- **param `int mode`:**
mode_param_doc

> *Changed in version 3.11.*
> Accepts path-like object for filename.

`ndbm` objects behave similar to mutable mappings,
but methods `items()`, `values()`, `pop()`, `popitem()`,
and `update()` are not supported,
the `keys()` method returns a list, and
the `setdefault()` method requires two arguments.
It also supports a "closing" context manager via the `with` keyword.

> *Changed in version 3.2.*
> Added the `get()` and `setdefault()` methods.

> *Changed in version 3.13.*
> Added the `clear()` method.

The following method is also provided:

### `ndbm.close()`

Close the NDBM database.
