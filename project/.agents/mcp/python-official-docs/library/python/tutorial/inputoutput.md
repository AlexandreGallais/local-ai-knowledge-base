# Input and output

There are several ways to present the output of a program; data can be printed
in a human-readable form, or written to a file for future use. This chapter will
discuss some of the possibilities.

## Fancier output formatting

So far we've encountered two ways of writing values: *expression statements* and
the `print()` function.  (A third way is using the `write()` method
of file objects; the standard output file can be referenced as `sys.stdout`.
See the Library Reference for more information on this.)

Often you'll want more control over the formatting of your output than simply
printing space-separated values. There are several ways to format output.

- To use formatted string literals, begin a string
with `f` or `F` before the opening quotation mark or triple quotation mark.
Inside this string, you can write a Python expression between `{` and `}`
characters that can refer to variables or literal values.

```
>>> year = 2016
>>> event = 'Referendum'
>>> f'Results of the {year} {event}'
'Results of the 2016 Referendum'
```

- The `str.format()` method of strings requires more manual
effort.  You'll still use `{` and `}` to mark where a variable
will be substituted and can provide detailed formatting directives,
but you'll also need to provide the information to be formatted. In the following code
block there are two examples of how to format variables:

```
>>> yes_votes = 42_572_654
>>> total_votes = 85_705_149
>>> percentage = yes_votes / total_votes
>>> '{:-9} YES votes  {:2.2%}'.format(yes_votes, percentage)
' 42572654 YES votes  49.67%'
```

Notice how the `yes_votes` are padded with spaces and a negative sign only for negative numbers.
The example also prints `percentage` multiplied by 100, with 2 decimal
places and followed by a percent sign (see formatspec for details).

- Finally, you can do all the string handling yourself by using string slicing and
concatenation operations to create any layout you can imagine.  The
string type has some methods that perform useful operations for padding
strings to a given column width.

When you don't need fancy output but just want a quick display of some
variables for debugging purposes, you can convert any value to a string with
the `repr()` or `str()` functions.

The `str()` function is meant to return representations of values which are
fairly human-readable, while `repr()` is meant to generate representations
which can be read by the interpreter (or will force a `SyntaxError` if
there is no equivalent syntax).  For objects which don't have a particular
representation for human consumption, `str()` will return the same value as
`repr()`.  Many values, such as numbers or structures like lists and
dictionaries, have the same representation using either function.  Strings, in
particular, have two distinct representations.

Some examples:

```
>>> s = 'Hello, world.'
>>> str(s)
'Hello, world.'
>>> repr(s)
"'Hello, world.'"
>>> str(1/7)
'0.14285714285714285'
>>> x = 10 * 3.25
>>> y = 200 * 200
>>> s = 'The value of x is ' + repr(x) + ', and y is ' + repr(y) + '...'
>>> print(s)
The value of x is 32.5, and y is 40000...
>>> # The repr() of a string adds string quotes and backslashes:
>>> hello = 'hello, world\n'
>>> hellos = repr(hello)
>>> print(hellos)
'hello, world\n'
>>> # The argument to repr() may be any Python object:
>>> repr((x, y, ('spam', 'eggs')))
"(32.5, 40000, ('spam', 'eggs'))"
```

The `string` module contains support for a simple templating approach
based upon regular expressions, via `string.Template`.
This offers yet another way to substitute values into strings,
using placeholders like `$x` and replacing them with values from a dictionary.
This syntax is easy to use, although it offers much less control for formatting.

### Formatted string literals

Formatted string literals (also called f-strings for
short) let you include the value of Python expressions inside a string by
prefixing the string with `f` or `F` and writing expressions as
`{expression}`.

An optional format specifier can follow the expression. This allows greater
control over how the value is formatted. The following example rounds pi to
three places after the decimal:

```
>>> import math
>>> print(f'The value of pi is approximately {math.pi:.3f}.')
The value of pi is approximately 3.142.
```

Passing an integer after the `':'` will cause that field to be a minimum
number of characters wide.  This is useful for making columns line up.:

```
>>> table = {'Sjoerd': 4127, 'Jack': 4098, 'Dcab': 7678}
>>> for name, phone in table.items():
...     print(f'{name:10} ==> {phone:10d}')
...
Sjoerd     ==>       4127
Jack       ==>       4098
Dcab       ==>       7678
```

Other modifiers can be used to convert the value before it is formatted.
`'!a'` applies `ascii()`, `'!s'` applies `str()`, and `'!r'`
applies `repr()`:

```
>>> animals = 'eels'
>>> print(f'My hovercraft is full of {animals}.')
My hovercraft is full of eels.
>>> print(f'My hovercraft is full of {animals!r}.')
My hovercraft is full of 'eels'.
```

The `=` specifier can be used to expand an expression to the text of the
expression, an equal sign, then the representation of the evaluated expression:

```python
>>> bugs = 'roaches'
>>> count = 13
>>> area = 'living room'
>>> print(f'Debugging {bugs=} {count=} {area=}')
Debugging bugs='roaches' count=13 area='living room'
```

See self-documenting expressions for more information
on the `=` specifier. For a reference on these format specifications, see
the reference guide for the formatspec.

### The string format() method

Basic usage of the `str.format()` method looks like this:

```
>>> print('We are the {} who say "{}!"'.format('knights', 'Ni'))
We are the knights who say "Ni!"
```

The brackets and characters within them (called format fields) are replaced with
the objects passed into the `str.format()` method.  A number in the
brackets can be used to refer to the position of the object passed into the
`str.format()` method.:

```
>>> print('{0} and {1}'.format('spam', 'eggs'))
spam and eggs
>>> print('{1} and {0}'.format('spam', 'eggs'))
eggs and spam
```

If keyword arguments are used in the `str.format()` method, their values
are referred to by using the name of the argument.:

```
>>> print('This {food} is {adjective}.'.format(
...       food='spam', adjective='absolutely horrible'))
This spam is absolutely horrible.
```

Positional and keyword arguments can be arbitrarily combined:

```
>>> print('The story of {0}, {1}, and {other}.'.format('Bill', 'Manfred',
...                                                    other='Georg'))
The story of Bill, Manfred, and Georg.
```

If you have a really long format string that you don't want to split up, it
would be nice if you could reference the variables to be formatted by name
instead of by position.  This can be done by simply passing the dict and using
square brackets `'[]'` to access the keys.:

```
>>> table = {'Sjoerd': 4127, 'Jack': 4098, 'Dcab': 8637678}
>>> print('Jack: {0[Jack]:d}; Sjoerd: {0[Sjoerd]:d}; '
...       'Dcab: {0[Dcab]:d}'.format(table))
Jack: 4098; Sjoerd: 4127; Dcab: 8637678
```

This could also be done by passing the `table` dictionary as keyword arguments with the `**`
notation.:

```
>>> table = {'Sjoerd': 4127, 'Jack': 4098, 'Dcab': 8637678}
>>> print('Jack: {Jack:d}; Sjoerd: {Sjoerd:d}; Dcab: {Dcab:d}'.format(**table))
Jack: 4098; Sjoerd: 4127; Dcab: 8637678
```

This is particularly useful in combination with the built-in function
`vars()`, which returns a dictionary containing all local variables:

```
>>> table = {k: str(v) for k, v in vars().items()}
>>> message = " ".join([f'{k}: ' + '{' + k +'};' for k in table.keys()])
>>> print(message.format(**table))
__name__: __main__; __doc__: None; __package__: None; __loader__: ...
```

As an example, the following lines produce a tidily aligned
set of columns giving integers and their squares and cubes:

```
>>> for x in range(1, 11):
...     print('{0:2d} {1:3d} {2:4d}'.format(x, x*x, x*x*x))
...
 1   1    1
 2   4    8
 3   9   27
 4  16   64
 5  25  125
 6  36  216
 7  49  343
 8  64  512
 9  81  729
10 100 1000
```

For a complete overview of string formatting with `str.format()`, see
formatstrings.

### Manual string formatting

Here's the same table of squares and cubes, formatted manually:

```
>>> for x in range(1, 11):
...     print(repr(x).rjust(2), repr(x*x).rjust(3), end=' ')
...     # Note use of 'end' on previous line
...     print(repr(x*x*x).rjust(4))
...
 1   1    1
 2   4    8
 3   9   27
 4  16   64
 5  25  125
 6  36  216
 7  49  343
 8  64  512
 9  81  729
10 100 1000
```

(Note that the one space between each column was added by the
way `print()` works: it always adds spaces between its arguments.)

The `str.rjust()` method of string objects right-justifies a string in a
field of a given width by padding it with spaces on the left. There are
similar methods `str.ljust()` and `str.center()`. These methods do
not write anything, they just return a new string. If the input string is too
long, they don't truncate it, but return it unchanged; this will mess up your
column lay-out but that's usually better than the alternative, which would be
lying about a value. (If you really want truncation you can always add a
slice operation, as in `x.ljust(n)[:n]`.)

There is another method, `str.zfill()`, which pads a numeric string on the
left with zeros.  It understands about plus and minus signs:

```
>>> '12'.zfill(5)
'00012'
>>> '-3.14'.zfill(7)
'-003.14'
>>> '3.14159265359'.zfill(5)
'3.14159265359'
```

### Old string formatting

The % operator (modulo) can also be used for string formatting.
Given `format % values` (where *format* is a string),
`%` conversion specifications in *format* are replaced with
zero or more elements of *values*.
This operation is commonly known as string
interpolation. For example:

```
>>> import math
>>> print('The value of pi is approximately %5.3f.' % math.pi)
The value of pi is approximately 3.142.
```

More information can be found in the old-string-formatting section.
