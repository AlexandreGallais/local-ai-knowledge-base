# binary-source-behavioral

This article categorizes each breaking change as *binary incompatible* or *source incompatible*, or as a *behavioral change*:

- **Binary incompatible** - When run against the new runtime or component, existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, and if so, require recompilation.

- **Source incompatible** - When recompiled using the new SDK or component or to target the new runtime, existing source code may require source changes to compile successfully.

- **Behavioral change** - Existing code and binaries may behave differently at runtime. If the new behavior is undesirable, existing code would need to be updated and recompiled.
