# redirecttologin-component

The `RedirectToLogin` component (`RedirectToLogin.razor`):

* Manages redirecting unauthorized users to the login page.
* The current URL that the user is attempting to access is maintained so that they can be returned to that page if authentication is successful using:
  * Navigation history state in ASP.NET Core in .NET 7 or later.
  * A query string in ASP.NET Core in .NET 6 or earlier.

Inspect the `RedirectToLogin` component in reference source. The location of the component changed over time, so use GitHub search tools to locate the component.
