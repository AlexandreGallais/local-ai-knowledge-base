# Expression class (part 2 of 32)

## Expression.AddAssignChecked(Expression, Expression, MethodInfo, LambdaExpression) method

```csharp
public static System.Linq.Expressions.BinaryExpression AddAssignChecked (System.Linq.Expressions.Expression left, System.Linq.Expressions.Expression right, System.Reflection.MethodInfo? method, System.Linq.Expressions.LambdaExpression? conversion);
```

Creates a `BinaryExpression` that represents an addition assignment operation that has overflow checking.

Parameters:

- `left`: An `Expression` to set the `BinaryExpression.Left` property equal to.
- `right`: An `Expression` to set the `BinaryExpression.Right` property equal to.
- `method`: A `MethodInfo` to set the `BinaryExpression.Method` property equal to.
- `conversion`: A `LambdaExpression` to set the `BinaryExpression.Conversion` property equal to.

Returns: A `BinaryExpression` that has the `Expression.NodeType` property equal to `ExpressionType.AddAssignChecked` and the `BinaryExpression.Left`, `BinaryExpression.Right`, `BinaryExpression.Method`, and `BinaryExpression.Conversion` properties set to the specified values.

To be added.

## Expression.AddChecked(Expression, Expression) method

```csharp
public static System.Linq.Expressions.BinaryExpression AddChecked (System.Linq.Expressions.Expression left, System.Linq.Expressions.Expression right);
```

Creates a `BinaryExpression` that represents an arithmetic addition operation that has overflow checking.

Parameters:

- `left`: A `Expression` to set the `BinaryExpression.Left` property equal to.
- `right`: A `Expression` to set the `BinaryExpression.Right` property equal to.

Returns: A `BinaryExpression` that has the `Expression.NodeType` property equal to `ExpressionType.AddChecked` and the `BinaryExpression.Left` and `BinaryExpression.Right` properties set to the specified values.

Exceptions:

- `ArgumentNullException`: `left` or `right` is `null`.
- `InvalidOperationException`: The addition operator is not defined for `left`.Type and `right`.Type.

#### Remarks
The resulting `BinaryExpression` has the `Method` property set to the implementing method. The `Type` property is set to the type of the node. If the node is lifted, the `BinaryExpression.IsLifted` and `BinaryExpression.IsLiftedToNull` properties are both `true`. Otherwise, they are `false`. The `Conversion` property is `null`.

The following information describes the implementing method, the node type, and whether a node is lifted.

#### Implementing Method
The following rules determine the implementing method for the operation:

- If the `Type` property of either `left` or `right` represents a user-defined type that overloads the addition operator, the `MethodInfo` that represents that method is the implementing method.

- Otherwise, if `left`.Type and `right`.Type are numeric types, the implementing method is `null`.

#### Node Type and Lifted versus Non-Lifted
If the implementing method is not `null`:

- If `left`.Type and `right`.Type are assignable to the corresponding argument types of the implementing method, the node is not lifted. The type of the node is the return type of the implementing method.

- If the following two conditions are satisfied, the node is lifted and the type of the node is the nullable type that corresponds to the return type of the implementing method:

- `left`.Type and `right`.Type are both value types of which at least one is nullable and the corresponding non-nullable types are equal to the corresponding argument types of the implementing method.

- The return type of the implementing method is a non-nullable value type.

If the implementing method is `null`:

- If `left`.Type and `right`.Type are both non-nullable, the node is not lifted. The type of the node is the result type of the predefined addition operator.

- If `left`.Type and `right`.Type are both nullable, the node is lifted. The type of the node is the nullable type that corresponds to the result type of the predefined addition operator.

## Expression.AddChecked(Expression, Expression, MethodInfo) method

```csharp
public static System.Linq.Expressions.BinaryExpression AddChecked (System.Linq.Expressions.Expression left, System.Linq.Expressions.Expression right, System.Reflection.MethodInfo? method);
```

Creates a `BinaryExpression` that represents an arithmetic addition operation that has overflow checking. The implementing method can be specified.

Parameters:

- `left`: A `Expression` to set the `BinaryExpression.Left` property equal to.
- `right`: A `Expression` to set the `BinaryExpression.Right` property equal to.
- `method`: A `MethodInfo` to set the `BinaryExpression.Method` property equal to.

Returns: A `BinaryExpression` that has the `Expression.NodeType` property equal to `ExpressionType.AddChecked` and the `BinaryExpression.Left`, `BinaryExpression.Right` and `BinaryExpression.Method` properties set to the specified values.

Exceptions:

- `ArgumentNullException`: `left` or `right` is `null`.
- `ArgumentException`: `method` is not `null` and the method it represents returns `void`, is not `static` (`Shared` in Visual Basic), or does not take exactly two arguments.
- `InvalidOperationException`: `method` is `null` and the addition operator is not defined for `left`.Type and `right`.Type.

#### Remarks
The resulting `BinaryExpression` has the `Method` property set to the implementing method. The `Type` property is set to the type of the node. If the node is lifted, the `BinaryExpression.IsLifted` and `BinaryExpression.IsLiftedToNull` properties are both `true`. Otherwise, they are `false`. The `Conversion` property is `null`.

The following information describes the implementing method, the node type, and whether a node is lifted.

#### Implementing Method
The implementing method for the operation is chosen based on the following rules:

- If `method` is not `null` and it represents a non-void, `static` (`Shared` in Visual Basic) method that takes two arguments, it is the implementing method for the node.

- Otherwise, if the `Type` property of either `left` or `right` represents a user-defined type that overloads the addition operator, the `MethodInfo` that represents that method is the implementing method.

- Otherwise, if `left`.Type and `right`.Type are numeric types, the implementing method is `null`.

#### Node Type and Lifted versus Non-Lifted
If the implementing method is not `null`:

- If `left`.Type and `right`.Type are assignable to the corresponding argument types of the implementing method, the node is not lifted. The type of the node is the return type of the implementing method.

- If the following two conditions are satisfied, the node is lifted and the type of the node is the nullable type that corresponds to the return type of the implementing method:

- `left`.Type and `right`.Type are both value types of which at least one is nullable and the corresponding non-nullable types are equal to the corresponding argument types of the implementing method.

- The return type of the implementing method is a non-nullable value type.

If the implementing method is `null`:

- If `left`.Type and `right`.Type are both non-nullable, the node is not lifted. The type of the node is the result type of the predefined addition operator.

- If `left`.Type and `right`.Type are both nullable, the node is lifted. The type of the node is the nullable type that corresponds to the result type of the predefined addition operator.

## Expression.And(Expression, Expression) method

```csharp
public static System.Linq.Expressions.BinaryExpression And (System.Linq.Expressions.Expression left, System.Linq.Expressions.Expression right);
```

Creates a `BinaryExpression` that represents a bitwise `AND` operation.

Parameters:

- `left`: A `Expression` to set the `BinaryExpression.Left` property equal to.
- `right`: A `Expression` to set the `BinaryExpression.Right` property equal to.

Returns: A `BinaryExpression` that has the `Expression.NodeType` property equal to `ExpressionType.And` and the `BinaryExpression.Left` and `BinaryExpression.Right` properties set to the specified values.

Exceptions:

- `ArgumentNullException`: `left` or `right` is `null`.
- `InvalidOperationException`: The bitwise `AND` operator is not defined for `left`.Type and `right`.Type.

#### Remarks
The resulting `BinaryExpression` has the `Method` property set to the implementing method. The `Type` property is set to the type of the node. If the node is lifted, the `BinaryExpression.IsLifted` and `BinaryExpression.IsLiftedToNull` properties are both `true`. Otherwise, they are `false`. The `Conversion` property is `null`.

The following information describes the implementing method, the node type, and whether a node is lifted.

#### Implementing Method
The following rules determine the implementing method for the operation:

- If the `Type` property of either `left` or `right` represents a user-defined type that overloads the bitwise `AND` operator, the `MethodInfo` that represents that method is the implementing method.

- Otherwise, if `left`.Type and `right`.Type are integral or Boolean types, the implementing method is `null`.

#### Node Type and Lifted versus Non-Lifted
If the implementing method is not `null`:

- If `left`.Type and `right`.Type are assignable to the corresponding argument types of the implementing method, the node is not lifted. The type of the node is the return type of the implementing method.

- If the following two conditions are satisfied, the node is lifted and the type of the node is the nullable type that corresponds to the return type of the implementing method:

- `left`.Type and `right`.Type are both value types of which at least one is nullable and the corresponding non-nullable types are equal to the corresponding argument types of the implementing method.

- The return type of the implementing method is a non-nullable value type.

If the implementing method is `null`:

- If `left`.Type and `right`.Type are both non-nullable, the node is not lifted. The type of the node is the result type of the predefined bitwise `AND` operator.

- If `left`.Type and `right`.Type are both nullable, the node is lifted. The type of the node is the nullable type that corresponds to the result type of the predefined bitwise `AND` operator.

#### Examples
The following code example shows how to create an expression that represents a logical AND operation on two Boolean values.

If the node is lifted, the `BinaryExpression.IsLifted` and `BinaryExpression.IsLiftedToNull` properties are both `true`. Otherwise, they are `false`. The `Conversion` property is `null`.

The following information describes the implementing method, the node type, and whether a node is lifted.

#### Implementing Method
The implementing method for the operation is chosen based on the following rules:

- If `method` is not `null` and it represents a non-void, `static` (`Shared` in Visual Basic) method that takes two arguments, it is the implementing method for the node.

- Otherwise, if the `Type` property of either `left` or `right` represents a user-defined type that overloads the bitwise `AND` operator, the `MethodInfo` that represents that method is the implementing method.

- `left`.Type and `right`.Type are both value types of which at least one is nullable and the corresponding non-nullable types are equal to the corresponding argument types of the implementing method.

- The return type of the implementing method is a non-nullable value type.

If the implementing method is `null`:

- If `left`.Type and `right`.Type are both non-nullable, the node is not lifted. The type of the node is the result type of the predefined bitwise `AND` operator.

- If `left`.Type and `right`.Type are both nullable, the node is lifted. The type of the node is the nullable type that corresponds to the result type of the predefined bitwise `AND` operator.
