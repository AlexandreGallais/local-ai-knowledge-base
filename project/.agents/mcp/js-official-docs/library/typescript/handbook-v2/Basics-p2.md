# The Basics (part 2 of 2)

## Downleveling

One other difference from the above was that our template string was rewritten from

```js
`Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!`;
```

to

```js
"Hello ".concat(person, ", today is ").concat(date.toDateString(), "!");
```

Why did this happen?

Template strings are a feature from a version of ECMAScript called ECMAScript 2015 (a.k.a. ECMAScript 6, ES2015, ES6, etc. - _don't ask_).
TypeScript has the ability to rewrite code from newer versions of ECMAScript to older ones such as ECMAScript 3 or ECMAScript 5 (a.k.a. ES5).
This process of moving from a newer or "higher" version of ECMAScript down to an older or "lower" one is sometimes called _downleveling_.

By default TypeScript targets ES5, an extremely old version of ECMAScript.
We could have chosen something a little bit more recent by using the `target` option.
Running with `--target es2015` changes TypeScript to target ECMAScript 2015, meaning code should be able to run wherever ECMAScript 2015 is supported.
So running `tsc --target es2015 hello.ts` gives us the following output:

```js
function greet(person, date) {
  console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!`);
}
greet("Maddison", new Date());
```

> While the default target is ES5, the great majority of current browsers support ES2015.
> Most developers can therefore safely specify ES2015 or above as a target, unless compatibility with certain ancient browsers is important.

## Strictness

Different users come to TypeScript looking for different things in a type-checker.
Some people are looking for a more loose opt-in experience which can help validate only some parts of their program, and still have decent tooling.
This is the default experience with TypeScript, where types are optional, inference takes the most lenient types, and there's no checking for potentially `null`/`undefined` values.
Much like how `tsc` emits in the face of errors, these defaults are put in place to stay out of your way.
If you're migrating existing JavaScript, that might be a desirable first step.

In contrast, a lot of users prefer to have TypeScript validate as much as it can straight away, and that's why the language provides strictness settings as well.
These strictness settings turn static type-checking from a switch (either your code is checked or not) into something closer to a dial.
The further you turn this dial up, the more TypeScript will check for you.
This can require a little extra work, but generally speaking it pays for itself in the long run, and enables more thorough checks and more accurate tooling.
When possible, a new codebase should always turn these strictness checks on.

TypeScript has several type-checking strictness flags that can be turned on or off, and all of our examples will be written with all of them enabled unless otherwise stated.
The `strict` flag in the CLI, or `"strict": true` in a `tsconfig.json` toggles them all on simultaneously, but we can opt out of them individually.
The two biggest ones you should know about are `noImplicitAny` and `strictNullChecks`.

## `noImplicitAny`

Recall that in some places, TypeScript doesn't try to infer types for us and instead falls back to the most lenient type: `any`.
This isn't the worst thing that can happen - after all, falling back to `any` is just the plain JavaScript experience anyway.

However, using `any` often defeats the purpose of using TypeScript in the first place.
The more typed your program is, the more validation and tooling you'll get, meaning you'll run into fewer bugs as you code.
Turning on the `noImplicitAny` flag will issue an error on any variables whose type is implicitly inferred as `any`.

## `strictNullChecks`

By default, values like `null` and `undefined` are assignable to any other type.
This can make writing some code easier, but forgetting to handle `null` and `undefined` is the cause of countless bugs in the world - some consider it a billion dollar mistake!
The `strictNullChecks` flag makes handling `null` and `undefined` more explicit, and _spares_ us from worrying about whether we _forgot_ to handle `null` and `undefined`.
