# Functions

Functions are the fundamental building block of any application in JavaScript.
They're how you build up layers of abstraction, mimicking classes, information hiding, and modules.
In TypeScript, while there are classes, namespaces, and modules, functions still play the key role in describing how to _do_ things.
TypeScript also adds some new capabilities to the standard JavaScript functions to make them easier to work with.

## Functions

To begin, just as in JavaScript, TypeScript functions can be created both as a named function or as an anonymous function.
This allows you to choose the most appropriate approach for your application, whether you're building a list of functions in an API or a one-off function to hand off to another function.

To quickly recap what these two approaches look like in JavaScript:

```ts
// Named function
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

// Anonymous function
let myAdd = function (x, y) {
  return x + y;
};
```

Just as in JavaScript, functions can refer to variables outside of the function body.
When they do so, they're said to _capture_ these variables.
While understanding how this works (and the trade-offs when using this technique) is outside of the scope of this article, having a firm understanding how this mechanic works is an important piece of working with JavaScript and TypeScript.

```ts
let z = 100;

function addToZ(x, y) {
  return x + y + z;
}
```

## Function Types

### Typing the function

Let's add types to our simple examples from earlier:

```ts
function add(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}

let myAdd = function (x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
};
```

We can add types to each of the parameters and then to the function itself to add a return type.
TypeScript can figure the return type out by looking at the return statements, so we can also optionally leave this off in many cases.

### Writing the function type

Now that we've typed the function, let's write the full type of the function out by looking at each piece of the function type.

```ts
let myAdd: (x: number, y: number) => number = function (
  x: number,
  y: number
): number {
  return x + y;
};
```

A function's type has the same two parts: the type of the arguments and the return type.
When writing out the whole function type, both parts are required.
We write out the parameter types just like a parameter list, giving each parameter a name and a type.
This name is just to help with readability.
We could have instead written:

```ts
let myAdd: (baseValue: number, increment: number) => number = function (
  x: number,
  y: number
): number {
  return x + y;
};
```

As long as the parameter types line up, it's considered a valid type for the function, regardless of the names you give the parameters in the function type.

The second part is the return type.
We make it clear which is the return type by using an arrow (`=>`) between the parameters and the return type.
As mentioned before, this is a required part of the function type, so if the function doesn't return a value, you would use `void` instead of leaving it off.

Of note, only the parameters and the return type make up the function type.
Captured variables are not reflected in the type.
In effect, captured variables are part of the "hidden state" of any function and do not make up its API.

### Inferring the types

In playing with the example, you may notice that the TypeScript compiler can figure out the type even if you only have types on one side of the equation:

```ts
// The parameters 'x' and 'y' have the type number
let myAdd = function (x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
};

// myAdd has the full function type
let myAdd2: (baseValue: number, increment: number) => number = function (x, y) {
  return x + y;
};
```

This is called "contextual typing", a form of type inference.
This helps cut down on the amount of effort to keep your program typed.

## Optional and Default Parameters

In TypeScript, every parameter is assumed to be required by the function.
This doesn't mean that it can't be given `null` or `undefined`, but rather, when the function is called, the compiler will check that the user has provided a value for each parameter.
The compiler also assumes that these parameters are the only parameters that will be passed to the function.
In short, the number of arguments given to a function has to match the number of parameters the function expects.

```ts
function buildName(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
  return firstName + " " + lastName;
}

let result1 = buildName("Bob"); // error, too few parameters
let result2 = buildName("Bob", "Adams", "Sr."); // error, too many parameters
let result3 = buildName("Bob", "Adams"); // ah, just right
```

In JavaScript, every parameter is optional, and users may leave them off as they see fit.
When they do, their value is `undefined`.
We can get this functionality in TypeScript by adding a `?` to the end of parameters we want to be optional.
For example, let's say we want the last name parameter from above to be optional:

```ts
function buildName(firstName: string, lastName?: string) {
  if (lastName) return firstName + " " + lastName;
  else return firstName;
}

let result1 = buildName("Bob"); // works correctly now
let result2 = buildName("Bob", "Adams", "Sr."); // error, too many parameters
let result3 = buildName("Bob", "Adams"); // ah, just right
```

Any optional parameters must follow required parameters.
Had we wanted to make the first name optional, rather than the last name, we would need to change the order of parameters in the function, putting the first name last in the list.

In TypeScript, we can also set a value that a parameter will be assigned if the user does not provide one, or if the user passes `undefined` in its place.
These are called default-initialized parameters.
Let's take the previous example and default the last name to `"Smith"`.

```ts
function buildName(firstName: string, lastName = "Smith") {
  return firstName + " " + lastName;
}

let result1 = buildName("Bob"); // works correctly now, returns "Bob Smith"
let result2 = buildName("Bob", undefined); // still works, also returns "Bob Smith"
let result3 = buildName("Bob", "Adams", "Sr."); // error, too many parameters
let result4 = buildName("Bob", "Adams"); // ah, just right
```

Default-initialized parameters that come after all required parameters are treated as optional, and just like optional parameters, can be omitted when calling their respective function.
This means optional parameters and trailing default parameters will share commonality in their types, so both

```ts
function buildName(firstName: string, lastName?: string) {
  // ...
}
```

and

```ts
function buildName(firstName: string, lastName = "Smith") {
  // ...
}
```

share the same type `(firstName: string, lastName?: string) => string`.
The default value of `lastName` disappears in the type, only leaving behind the fact that the parameter is optional.

Unlike plain optional parameters, default-initialized parameters don't _need_ to occur after required parameters.
If a default-initialized parameter comes before a required parameter, users need to explicitly pass `undefined` to get the default initialized value.
For example, we could write our last example with only a default initializer on `firstName`:

```ts
function buildName(firstName = "Will", lastName: string) {
  return firstName + " " + lastName;
}

let result1 = buildName("Bob"); // error, too few parameters
let result2 = buildName("Bob", "Adams", "Sr."); // error, too many parameters
let result3 = buildName("Bob", "Adams"); // okay and returns "Bob Adams"
let result4 = buildName(undefined, "Adams"); // okay and returns "Will Adams"
```

### Rest Parameters

Required, optional, and default parameters all have one thing in common: they talk about one parameter at a time.
Sometimes, you want to work with multiple parameters as a group, or you may not know how many parameters a function will ultimately take.
In JavaScript, you can work with the arguments directly using the `arguments` variable that is visible inside every function body.

In TypeScript, you can gather these arguments together into a variable:

```ts
function buildName(firstName: string, ...restOfName: string[]) {
  return firstName + " " + restOfName.join(" ");
}

// employeeName will be "Joseph Samuel Lucas MacKinzie"
let employeeName = buildName("Joseph", "Samuel", "Lucas", "MacKinzie");
```

_Rest parameters_ are treated as a boundless number of optional parameters.
When passing arguments for a rest parameter, you can use as many as you want; you can even pass none.
The compiler will build an array of the arguments passed in with the name given after the ellipsis (`...`), allowing you to use it in your function.

The ellipsis is also used in the type of the function with rest parameters:

```ts
function buildName(firstName: string, ...restOfName: string[]) {
  return firstName + " " + restOfName.join(" ");
}

let buildNameFun: (fname: string, ...rest: string[]) => string = buildName;
```
