# Vi (part 3 of 6)

### vi.dynamicImportSettled

```ts
function dynamicImportSettled(): Promise<void>
```

Wait for all imports to load. Useful, if you have a synchronous call that starts importing a module that you cannot wait otherwise.

```ts
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'

// cannot track import because Promise is not returned
function renderComponent() {
  import('./component.js').then(({ render }) => {
    render()
  })
}

test('operations are resolved', async () => {
  renderComponent()
  await vi.dynamicImportSettled()
  expect(document.querySelector('.component')).not.toBeNull()
})
```

**Tip:**
If during a dynamic import another dynamic import is initiated, this method will wait until all of them are resolved.

This method will also wait for the next `setTimeout` tick after the import is resolved so all synchronous operations should be completed by the time it's resolved.
