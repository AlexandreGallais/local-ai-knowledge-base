# SourceBuffer: error event

The **`error`** event of the `SourceBuffer` interface is fired when an error occurs during the processing of an `appendBuffer()` operation. This may happen, for example, if the data being appended is not in the expected format, the `SourceBuffer` is in an invalid state, or the user agent is unable to process the data. The `updating` property transitions from `true` to `false`. This event is fired before the `updateend` event.

## Syntax

Use the event name in `addEventListener()`:

```js
addEventListener("error", (event) => { })
```

Alternatively, assign to the event handler property of the interface:

```js
onerror = (event) => { }
```

## Event type

A generic `Event`.

## Examples

### Handling errors during appendBuffer()

This example demonstrates how to handle errors that occur during the `appendBuffer()` operation.

```js
const sourceBuffer = source.addSourceBuffer(mimeCodec);
sourceBuffer.addEventListener("error", () => {
  downloadStatus.textContent = "Error occurred during decoding";
});
sourceBuffer.addEventListener("update", () => {
  downloadStatus.textContent = "Done";
});
sourceBuffer.addEventListener("updateend", () => {
  source.endOfStream();
});
downloadStatus.textContent = "Downloading...";
fetch(assetURL)
  .then((response) => response.arrayBuffer())
  .then((data) => {
    downloadStatus.textContent = "Decoding...";
    sourceBuffer.appendBuffer(data);
  });
```
