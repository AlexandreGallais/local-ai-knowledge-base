# RTCCodecStats: type property

The **`type`** property of the `RTCCodecStats` dictionary is a string with the value `"codec"`.

Different statistics are obtained by iterating the `RTCStatsReport` object returned by a call to `RTCPeerConnection.getStats()`.
The type indicates the set of statistics available through the object in a particular iteration step.
A value of `"codec"` indicates that the statistics available in the current step are those defined in `RTCCodecStats`.

## Value

A string with the value `"codec"`.
