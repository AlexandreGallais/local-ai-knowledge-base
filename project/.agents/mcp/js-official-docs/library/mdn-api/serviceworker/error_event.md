# ServiceWorker: error event

The `error` event fires whenever an error occurs in the service worker.

## Syntax

Use the event name in `addEventListener()`:

```js
addEventListener("error", (event) => { })
```

Alternatively, assign to the event handler property of the interface:

```js
onerror = (event) => { }
```

## Event type

A generic `Event`.

## Example

The following code snippet gets a handle to the `ServiceWorker` object via `ServiceWorkerRegistration.active` and sets up an `onerror` handler on the resulting object:

```js
// in the page being controlled
if (navigator.serviceWorker) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register("service-worker.js");

  navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((registration) => {
    registration.active.onerror = (event) => {
      console.log("An error occurred in the service worker!");
    };
  });
}
```
