# Location: host property

The **`host`** property of the `Location` interface is a string containing the host, which is the `hostname`, and then, if the port of the URL is nonempty, a `":"`, followed by the `port` of the URL. If the URL does not have a `hostname`, this property contains an empty string, `""`.

See `URL.host` for more information.

## Value

A string.

## Examples

```js
const anchor = document.createElement("a");

anchor.href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Location.host";
console.log(anchor.host === "developer.mozilla.org");

anchor.href = "https://developer.mozilla.org:443/en-US/Location.host";
console.log(anchor.host === "developer.mozilla.org");
// The port number is not included because 443 is the scheme's default port

anchor.href = "https://developer.mozilla.org:4097/en-US/Location.host";
console.log(anchor.host === "developer.mozilla.org:4097");
```
