# `position` CSS property (part 2 of 2)

## Examples

### Relative positioning

Relatively positioned elements are offset a given amount from their normal position within the document, but without the offset affecting other elements. In the example below, note how the other elements are placed as if "Two" were taking up the space of its normal location.

#### HTML

```html
<div class="box" id="one">One</div>
<div class="box" id="two">Two</div>
<div class="box" id="three">Three</div>
<div class="box" id="four">Four</div>
```

#### CSS

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.box {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: red;
  color: white;
}

#two {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
  background: blue;
}
```

### Absolute positioning

Elements that are relatively positioned remain in the normal flow of the document. In contrast, an element that is absolutely positioned is taken out of the flow; thus, other elements are positioned as if it did not exist. The absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to its _nearest positioned ancestor_ (i.e., the nearest ancestor that is not `static`). If a positioned ancestor doesn't exist, it is positioned relative to the ICB (initial containing block), which is the containing block of the document's root element.

#### HTML

```html
<h1>Absolute positioning</h1>

<p>
  I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new
  lines below me.
</p>

<p class="positioned">
  By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and we are as tall
  as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + padding +
  border width/height.
</p>

<p>
  We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are
  separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.
</p>

<p>
  inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on
  the same line as one another, and adjacent text nodes, if there is space on
  the same line. Overflowing inline elements
  <span>wrap onto a new line if possible — like this one containing text</span>,
  or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do:
  <img src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/long.jpg" />
</p>
```

#### CSS

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  width: 500px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

p {
  background: aqua;
  border: 3px solid blue;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 10px;
}

span {
  background: red;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

.positioned {
  position: absolute;
  background: yellow;
  inset-block-start: 30px;
  inset-inline-start: 30px;
}
```

#### Result

### Fixed positioning

Fixed positioning is similar to absolute positioning, with the exception that the element's containing block is the initial containing block established by the _viewport_, unless any ancestor has `transform`, `perspective`, or `filter` property set to something other than `none` (see fixed positioning containing block), which then causes that ancestor to take the place of the elements containing block. This can be used to create a "floating" element that stays in the same position regardless of scrolling. In the example below, box "One" is fixed at 80 pixels from the top of the page and 10 pixels from the left. Even after scrolling, it remains in the same place relative to the viewport. Also, when the `will-change` property is set to `transform`, a new containing block is established.

#### HTML

```html
<div class="outer">
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nam congue tortor
    eget pulvinar lobortis. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci luctus
    et ultrices posuere cubilia Curae; Nam ac dolor augue. Pellentesque mi mi,
    laoreet et dolor sit amet, ultrices varius risus. Nam vitae iaculis elit.
    Aliquam mollis interdum libero. Sed sodales placerat egestas. Vestibulum ut
    arcu aliquam purus viverra dictum vel sit amet mi. Duis nisl mauris, aliquam
    sit amet luctus eget, dapibus in enim. Sed velit augue, pretium a sem
    aliquam, congue porttitor tortor. Sed tempor nisl a lorem consequat, id
    maximus erat aliquet. Sed sagittis porta libero sed condimentum. Aliquam
    finibus lectus nec ante congue rutrum. Curabitur quam quam, accumsan id
    ultrices ultrices, tempor et tellus.

  </p>
  <div class="box" id="one">One</div>
</div>
```

#### CSS

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: red;
  color: white;
}

#one {
  position: fixed;
  top: 80px;
  left: 10px;
  background: blue;
}

.outer {
  width: 500px;
  height: 300px;
  overflow: scroll;
  padding-left: 150px;
}
```

#### Result

### Sticky positioning

The following CSS rule positions the element with id `one` relatively until the viewport is scrolled such that the element is 10 pixels from the top. Beyond that threshold, the element is fixed to 10 pixels from the top.

```css
#one {
  position: sticky;
  top: 10px;
}
```

#### List with sticky headings

A common use for sticky positioning is for the headings in an alphabetized list. The "B" heading will appear just below the items that begin with "A" until they are scrolled offscreen. Rather than sliding offscreen with the rest of the content, the "B" heading will then remain fixed to the top of the viewport until all the "B" items have scrolled offscreen, at which point it will be covered up by the "C" heading, and so on.

You must specify a threshold with at least one of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left` for sticky positioning to behave as expected. Otherwise, it will be indistinguishable from relative positioning.

    <dd>Apparat</dd>

  position: sticky;

  padding-left: 12px;
  white-space: nowrap;
}

dd + dd {
  border-top: 1px solid #cccccc;
}
```

#### Sticky position with all the inset boundaries set

The following example demonstrates an element's behavior when all inset boundaries are set. Here, we have two light bulb emojis in a paragraph. The light bulbs use sticky positioning, and the inset boundaries are specified as 50px from the top and bottom, and 100px from the left and right. A gray background on the parent div element marks the inset area.

##### HTML

```html
Use scrollbars to put the light bulbs(💡) in the right place in the following
text:
<div>
  <p>
    The representation of an idea by a light bulb(<span class="bulb">💡</span>)
    is a commonly used metaphor that symbolizes the moment of inspiration or the
    birth of a new idea. The association between a light bulb and an idea can be
    traced back to the invention of the incandescent light bulb(<span
      class="bulb"
      >💡</span
    >) by Thomas Edison in the late 19th century. The light bulb is a powerful
    symbol because it represents illumination, clarity, and the sudden
    brightening of one's thoughts or understanding. When someone has an idea, it
    is often described as a light bulb turning on in their mind, signifying a
    moment of insight or creativity. The image of a light bulb also suggests the
    idea of energy, power, and the potential for growth and development.
  </p>
</div>
```

##### CSS

```css
div {
  width: 400px;
  height: 200px;
  overflow: scroll;
  scrollbar-width: thin;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-family: "Verdana";
  border: 1px solid;
}

p {
  width: 600px;
  user-select: none;
  margin: 0;
  border: 110px solid transparent;
}
```

```css
.bulb {
  position: sticky;
  inset: 50px 100px;
}

div {
  /* mark area defined by the inset boundaries using gray color */
  background: linear-gradient(#99999999, #99999999) 100px 50px / 192px 100px
    no-repeat;
}
```

##### Result

When you put both bulbs in their proper place, you'll notice that they are relatively positioned inside the inset area. When you move them out of the inset area, they are fixed (sticky) to the inset boundary in that direction.
