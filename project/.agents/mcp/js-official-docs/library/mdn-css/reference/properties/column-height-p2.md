# `column-height` CSS property (part 2 of 3)

## Examples

### Basic usage

This example demonstrates basic usage of the `column-height` property to create a wrapped multi-col layout.

#### HTML

We include a poem by Dr. Seuss using an `` containing 28 ``s, followed by the author's name in a ``.

```html
<ol>
  <li>One fish</li>
  <li>Two fish</li>
  <li>Red fish</li>
  <li>Blue fish</li>
  ...
</ol>
<p>-- Dr. Seuss</p>
```

```html
<ol>
  <li>One fish</li>
  <li>Two fish</li>
  <li>Red fish</li>
  <li>Blue fish</li>
  <li>Black fish</li>
  <li>Blue fish</li>
  <li>Old fish</li>
  <li>New fish.</li>
  <li>This one has a little star.</li>
  <li>This one has a little car.</li>
  <li>Say! What a lot</li>
  <li>Of fish there are.</li>
  <li>Yes. Some are red. And some are blue.</li>
  <li>Some are old. And some are new.</li>
  <li>Some are sad.</li>
  <li>And some are glad.</li>
  <li>And some are very, very bad.</li>
  <li>Why are they</li>
  <li>Sad and glad and bad?</li>
  <li>I do not know.</li>
  <li>Go ask your dad.</li>
  <li>Some are thin.</li>
  <li>And some are fat.</li>
  <li>The fat one has</li>
  <li>A yellow hat.</li>
  <li>From there to here, from here to there,</li>
  <li>Funny things</li>
  <li>Are everywhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>--Dr. Seuss</p>
```

#### CSS

We define the `` to be a multi-column container by setting the `column-width` property to `150px`, meaning the container will contain as many columns as possible with each being at least `150px` wide. The `gap` property of `2em` sets a horizontal gap between columns and a vertical gap between rows of columns. We then set the `column-height` to `2em`, causing the `column-wrap` property's default `auto` value to resolve to `wrap` to create wrapped rows of columns.

```css
ol {
  column-width: 150px;
  gap: 2em;
  column-height: 3em;
}
```

#### Result

### Scroll-snapped columns

This example combines a wrapped multi-column layout with CSS scroll snapping, creating a usable experience where each scrolling action snaps a new row of columns neatly inside the full height of the viewport for comfortable reading.

#### HTML

The HTML, which contains multiple paragraphs of content from the MDN HTML, CSS, and JavaScript home pages, has been hidden for brevity.

```html
<h1>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript summaries</h1>
<p>
  <strong>HTML</strong> (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic <example-value>
  block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other
  technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
  appearance (CSS) or behavior (JavaScript).
</p>
<p>
  "Hypertext" refers to text containing links that connect web pages to one
  another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a
  fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and
  linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant
  in the World Wide Web.
</p>
<p>
  HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in
  a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as
  <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/head"
    ><code>&lt;head&gt;</code></a
  >,

  and many others.
</p>
<p>
  An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which
  consist of the element name surrounded by <code>&lt;</code> and
  <code>&gt;</code>. The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive.
  That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example,
  the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag can be written as
  <code>&lt;Title&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;TITLE&gt;</code>, or in any other way.
  However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in
  lowercase.

  <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong> (<strong>CSS</strong>) is a
  <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/StyleSheet">stylesheet</a> language used to
  describe the presentation of a document written in
  <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a> or
  <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/XML/Guides/XML_introduction">XML</a> (including XML
  dialects such as <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">SVG</a>,
  <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/MathML">MathML</a> or
  <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/XHTML">XHTML</a>). CSS describes how elements
  should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
</p>
<p>
  CSS is among the core languages of the <strong>open web</strong> and is
  standardized across web browsers according to
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/#specs" class="external" target="_blank"
    >W3C specifications</a
  >. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done
  synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You
  might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3
  or a CSS4; rather, everything is now just "CSS" with individual CSS modules
  having version numbers.
</p>
<p>
  After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the
  progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became
  more effective to
  <a
    href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work"
    class="external"
    target="_blank"
    >develop and release recommendations separately per module</a
  >. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a
  snapshot of
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css/" class="external" target="_blank"
    >the latest stable state of the CSS specification</a
  >
  and individual modules progress. CSS modules now have version numbers, or
  levels, such as
  <a
    href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/"
    class="external"
    target="_blank"
    >CSS Color Module Level 5</a
  >.

  The standards for JavaScript are the

  (ECMA-262) and the
  <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma402/" class="external" target="_blank"
    >ECMAScript Internationalization API specification</a

  (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to document
  it. This means that cases where some
  <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposals" class="external" target="_blank"
    >proposals for new ECMAScript features</a
  >
  have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN
  articles may use some of those new features. Most of the time, this happens
  between the
  <a href="https://tc39.es/process-document/" class="external" target="_blank"
    >stages</a

  3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially published.

</p>
```

#### CSS

We start by setting `column-width` on the `<body>` element to define the preferred width for the columns. A `gap` of `3em 2em` results in a `3em` gap between rows and a `2em` gap between columns. The `column-rule` adds a line in the center of the gap between the columns. The `column-height` of `95vh` makes the columns nearly as tall as the viewport.

We explicitly set `column-wrap` to `wrap` as a reminder of the applied wrapping behavior. We could have set the value to `auto` or omitted the property altogether, as, by default, `column-wrap` resolves to `wrap` when the `column-height` is set to a `<length>` value.

```css
body {
  column-width: 150px;
  column-rule: 2px solid red;
  gap: 3em 2em;
  padding: 0 2em;
  column-height: 95vh;
  column-wrap: wrap;
}
```

Next, we set the `<h1>` element's `column-span` property to `all`, to make the heading span across all the columns, and set the `margin-top` property of the first `` to `0` so that it lines up with the top of the columns.

```css
h1 {
  column-span: all;
}

p:first-of-type {
  margin-top: 0;
}
```

Finally, we add scroll snapping by setting `scroll-snap-type` to `y mandatory` on the `<html>` element, and `scroll-snap-align` to `start` on the `::column` pseudo-elements that represent each generated column. This causes the content to snap to the top of a new column each time it is scrolled.

```css
html {
  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
}

::column {
  scroll-snap-align: start;
}
```

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

html {
  font-family: "Arial", sans-serif;
}

p {
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```

```css
@supports not (column-height: 15em) {
  body::before {
    content: "Your browser does not support the 'column-height' property.";
    background-color: wheat;
    position: fixed;
    inset: 40% 0;
    height: fit-content;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 1rem 0;
  }
}
```

#### Result

Try scrolling the content. Note how each new row of columns fills the viewport, and how the content snaps neatly to the top of a new row with each scroll.
