# Bitwise OR assignment (|=)

The **bitwise OR assignment (`|=`)** operator performs bitwise OR on the two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.

```js
let a = 5; // 00000000000000000000000000000101
a |= 3; // 00000000000000000000000000000011

console.log(a); // 00000000000000000000000000000111
// Expected output: 7
```

## Syntax

```js
x |= y
```

## Description

`x |= y` is equivalent to `x = x | y`, except that the expression `x` is only evaluated once.

## Examples

### Using bitwise OR assignment

```js
let a = 5;
a |= 2; // 7
// 5: 00000000000000000000000000000101
// 2: 00000000000000000000000000000010
// -----------------------------------
// 7: 00000000000000000000000000000111

let b = 5n;
b |= 2n; // 7n
```
