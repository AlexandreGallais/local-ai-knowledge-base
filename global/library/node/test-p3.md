# Test runner (part 3 of 14)

## Collecting code coverage

> Stability: 1 - Experimental

When Node.js is started with the `--experimental-test-coverage`
command-line flag, code coverage is collected and statistics are reported once
all tests have completed. If the `NODE_V8_COVERAGE` environment variable is
used to specify a code coverage directory, the generated V8 coverage files are
written to that directory. Node.js core modules and files within
`node_modules/` directories are, by default, not included in the coverage report.
However, they can be explicitly included via the `--test-coverage-include` flag.
By default all the matching test files are excluded from the coverage report.
Exclusions can be overridden by using the `--test-coverage-exclude` flag.
If coverage is enabled, the coverage report is sent to any test reporters via
the `'test:coverage'` event.

Coverage can be disabled on a series of lines using the following
comment syntax:

```js
/* node:coverage disable */
if (anAlwaysFalseCondition) {
  // Code in this branch will never be executed, but the lines are ignored for
  // coverage purposes. All lines following the 'disable' comment are ignored
  // until a corresponding 'enable' comment is encountered.
  console.log('this is never executed');
}
/* node:coverage enable */
```

Coverage can also be disabled for a specified number of lines. After the
specified number of lines, coverage will be automatically reenabled. If the
number of lines is not explicitly provided, a single line is ignored.

```js
/* node:coverage ignore next */
if (anAlwaysFalseCondition) { console.log('this is never executed'); }

/* node:coverage ignore next 3 */
if (anAlwaysFalseCondition) {
  console.log('this is never executed');
}
```

### Coverage reporters

The tap and spec reporters will print a summary of the coverage statistics.
There is also an lcov reporter that will generate an lcov file which can be
used as an in depth coverage report.

```bash
node --test --experimental-test-coverage --test-reporter=lcov --test-reporter-destination=lcov.info
```

* No test results are reported by this reporter.
* This reporter should ideally be used alongside another reporter.

## Mocking

The `node:test` module supports mocking during testing via a top-level `mock`
object. The following example creates a spy on a function that adds two numbers
together. The spy is then used to assert that the function was called as
expected.

```mjs
import assert from 'node:assert';
import { mock, test } from 'node:test';

test('spies on a function', () => {
  const sum = mock.fn((a, b) => {
    return a + b;
  });

  assert.strictEqual(sum.mock.callCount(), 0);
  assert.strictEqual(sum(3, 4), 7);
  assert.strictEqual(sum.mock.callCount(), 1);

  const call = sum.mock.calls[0];
  assert.deepStrictEqual(call.arguments, [3, 4]);
  assert.strictEqual(call.result, 7);
  assert.strictEqual(call.error, undefined);

  // Reset the globally tracked mocks.
  mock.reset();
});
```

```cjs
const assert = require('node:assert');
const { mock, test } = require('node:test');

test('spies on a function', () => {
  const sum = mock.fn((a, b) => {
    return a + b;
  });

  assert.strictEqual(sum.mock.callCount(), 0);
  assert.strictEqual(sum(3, 4), 7);
  assert.strictEqual(sum.mock.callCount(), 1);

  const call = sum.mock.calls[0];
  assert.deepStrictEqual(call.arguments, [3, 4]);
  assert.strictEqual(call.result, 7);
  assert.strictEqual(call.error, undefined);

  // Reset the globally tracked mocks.
  mock.reset();
});
```

The same mocking functionality is also exposed on the `TestContext` object
of each test. The following example creates a spy on an object method using the
API exposed on the `TestContext`. The benefit of mocking via the test context is
that the test runner will automatically restore all mocked functionality once
the test finishes.

```js
test('spies on an object method', (t) => {
  const number = {
    value: 5,
    add(a) {
      return this.value + a;
    },
  };

  t.mock.method(number, 'add');
  assert.strictEqual(number.add.mock.callCount(), 0);
  assert.strictEqual(number.add(3), 8);
  assert.strictEqual(number.add.mock.callCount(), 1);

  const call = number.add.mock.calls[0];

  assert.deepStrictEqual(call.arguments, [3]);
  assert.strictEqual(call.result, 8);
  assert.strictEqual(call.target, undefined);
  assert.strictEqual(call.this, number);
});
```

### Timers

Mocking timers is a technique commonly used in software testing to simulate and
control the behavior of timers, such as `setInterval` and `setTimeout`,
without actually waiting for the specified time intervals.

Refer to the `MockTimers` class for a full list of methods and features.

This allows developers to write more reliable and
predictable tests for time-dependent functionality.

The example below shows how to mock `setTimeout`.
Using `.enable({ apis: ['setTimeout'] });`
it will mock the `setTimeout` functions in the node:timers and
node:timers/promises modules,
as well as from the Node.js global context.

**Note:** Destructuring functions such as
`import { setTimeout } from 'node:timers'`
is currently not supported by this API.

```mjs
import assert from 'node:assert';
import { mock, test } from 'node:test';

test('mocks setTimeout to be executed synchronously without having to actually wait for it', () => {
  const fn = mock.fn();

  // Optionally choose what to mock
  mock.timers.enable({ apis: ['setTimeout'] });
  setTimeout(fn, 9999);
  assert.strictEqual(fn.mock.callCount(), 0);

  // Advance in time
  mock.timers.tick(9999);
  assert.strictEqual(fn.mock.callCount(), 1);

  // Reset the globally tracked mocks.
  mock.timers.reset();

  // If you call reset mock instance, it will also reset timers instance
  mock.reset();
});
```

```cjs
const assert = require('node:assert');
const { mock, test } = require('node:test');

test('mocks setTimeout to be executed synchronously without having to actually wait for it', () => {
  const fn = mock.fn();

  // Optionally choose what to mock
  mock.timers.enable({ apis: ['setTimeout'] });
  setTimeout(fn, 9999);
  assert.strictEqual(fn.mock.callCount(), 0);

  // Advance in time
  mock.timers.tick(9999);
  assert.strictEqual(fn.mock.callCount(), 1);

  // Reset the globally tracked mocks.
  mock.timers.reset();

  // If you call reset mock instance, it will also reset timers instance
  mock.reset();
});
```

The same mocking functionality is also exposed in the mock property on the `TestContext` object
of each test. The benefit of mocking via the test context is
that the test runner will automatically restore all mocked timers
functionality once the test finishes.

```mjs
import assert from 'node:assert';
import { test } from 'node:test';

test('mocks setTimeout to be executed synchronously without having to actually wait for it', (context) => {
  const fn = context.mock.fn();

  // Optionally choose what to mock
  context.mock.timers.enable({ apis: ['setTimeout'] });
  setTimeout(fn, 9999);
  assert.strictEqual(fn.mock.callCount(), 0);

  // Advance in time
  context.mock.timers.tick(9999);
  assert.strictEqual(fn.mock.callCount(), 1);
});
```

```cjs
const assert = require('node:assert');
const { test } = require('node:test');

test('mocks setTimeout to be executed synchronously without having to actually wait for it', (context) => {
  const fn = context.mock.fn();

  // Optionally choose what to mock
  context.mock.timers.enable({ apis: ['setTimeout'] });
  setTimeout(fn, 9999);
  assert.strictEqual(fn.mock.callCount(), 0);

  // Advance in time
  context.mock.timers.tick(9999);
  assert.strictEqual(fn.mock.callCount(), 1);
});
```

### Dates

The mock timers API also allows the mocking of the `Date` object. This is a
useful feature for testing time-dependent functionality, or to simulate
internal calendar functions such as `Date.now()`.

The dates implementation is also part of the `MockTimers` class. Refer to it
for a full list of methods and features.

**Note:** Dates and timers are dependent when mocked together. This means that
if you have both the `Date` and `setTimeout` mocked, advancing the time will
also advance the mocked date as they simulate a single internal clock.

The example below show how to mock the `Date` object and obtain the current
`Date.now()` value.

```mjs
import assert from 'node:assert';
import { test } from 'node:test';

test('mocks the Date object', (context) => {
  // Optionally choose what to mock
  context.mock.timers.enable({ apis: ['Date'] });
  // If not specified, the initial date will be based on 0 in the UNIX epoch
  assert.strictEqual(Date.now(), 0);

  // Advance in time will also advance the date
  context.mock.timers.tick(9999);
  assert.strictEqual(Date.now(), 9999);
});
```

```cjs
const assert = require('node:assert');
const { test } = require('node:test');

test('mocks the Date object', (context) => {
  // Optionally choose what to mock
  context.mock.timers.enable({ apis: ['Date'] });
  // If not specified, the initial date will be based on 0 in the UNIX epoch
  assert.strictEqual(Date.now(), 0);

  // Advance in time will also advance the date
  context.mock.timers.tick(9999);
  assert.strictEqual(Date.now(), 9999);
});
```

If there is no initial epoch set, the initial date will be based on 0 in the
Unix epoch. This is January 1st, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC. You can set an initial date
by passing a `now` property to the `.enable()` method. This value will be used
as the initial date for the mocked `Date` object. It can either be a positive
integer, or another Date object.

```mjs
import assert from 'node:assert';
import { test } from 'node:test';

test('mocks the Date object with initial time', (context) => {
  // Optionally choose what to mock
  context.mock.timers.enable({ apis: ['Date'], now: 100 });
  assert.strictEqual(Date.now(), 100);

  // Advance in time will also advance the date
  context.mock.timers.tick(200);
  assert.strictEqual(Date.now(), 300);
});
```

```cjs
const assert = require('node:assert');
const { test } = require('node:test');

test('mocks the Date object with initial time', (context) => {
  // Optionally choose what to mock
  context.mock.timers.enable({ apis: ['Date'], now: 100 });
  assert.strictEqual(Date.now(), 100);

  // Advance in time will also advance the date
  context.mock.timers.tick(200);
  assert.strictEqual(Date.now(), 300);
});
```

You can use the `.setTime()` method to manually move the mocked date to another
time. This method only accepts a positive integer.

**Note:** This method will **not** execute any mocked timers that are in the past
from the new time.

In the below example we are setting a new time for the mocked date.

```mjs
import assert from 'node:assert';
import { test } from 'node:test';

test('sets the time of a date object', (context) => {
  // Optionally choose what to mock
  context.mock.timers.enable({ apis: ['Date'], now: 100 });
  assert.strictEqual(Date.now(), 100);

  // Advance in time will also advance the date
  context.mock.timers.setTime(1000);
  context.mock.timers.tick(200);
  assert.strictEqual(Date.now(), 1200);
});
```

```cjs
const assert = require('node:assert');
const { test } = require('node:test');

test('sets the time of a date object', (context) => {
  // Optionally choose what to mock
  context.mock.timers.enable({ apis: ['Date'], now: 100 });
  assert.strictEqual(Date.now(), 100);

  // Advance in time will also advance the date
  context.mock.timers.setTime(1000);
  context.mock.timers.tick(200);
  assert.strictEqual(Date.now(), 1200);
});
```

Timers scheduled in the past will **not** run when you call `setTime()`. To execute those timers, you can use
the `.tick()` method to move forward from the new time.

```mjs
import assert from 'node:assert';
import { test } from 'node:test';

test('setTime does not execute timers', (context) => {
  // Optionally choose what to mock
  context.mock.timers.enable({ apis: ['setTimeout', 'Date'] });
  const fn = context.mock.fn();
  setTimeout(fn, 1000);

  context.mock.timers.setTime(800);
  // Timer is not executed as the time is not yet reached
  assert.strictEqual(fn.mock.callCount(), 0);
  assert.strictEqual(Date.now(), 800);

  context.mock.timers.setTime(1200);
  // Timer is still not executed
  assert.strictEqual(fn.mock.callCount(), 0);
  // Advance in time to execute the timer
  context.mock.timers.tick(0);
  assert.strictEqual(fn.mock.callCount(), 1);
  assert.strictEqual(Date.now(), 1200);
});
```

```cjs
const assert = require('node:assert');
const { test } = require('node:test');

test('setTime does not execute timers', (context) => {
  // Optionally choose what to mock
  context.mock.timers.enable({ apis: ['setTimeout', 'Date'] });
  const fn = context.mock.fn();
  setTimeout(fn, 1000);

  context.mock.timers.setTime(800);
  // Timer is not executed as the time is not yet reached
  assert.strictEqual(fn.mock.callCount(), 0);
  assert.strictEqual(Date.now(), 800);

  context.mock.timers.setTime(1200);
  // Timer is still not executed
  assert.strictEqual(fn.mock.callCount(), 0);
  // Advance in time to execute the timer
  context.mock.timers.tick(0);
  assert.strictEqual(fn.mock.callCount(), 1);
  assert.strictEqual(Date.now(), 1200);
});
```

Using `.runAll()` will execute all timers that are currently in the queue. This
will also advance the mocked date to the time of the last timer that was
executed as if the time has passed.

```mjs
import assert from 'node:assert';
import { test } from 'node:test';

test('runs timers as setTime passes ticks', (context) => {
  // Optionally choose what to mock
  context.mock.timers.enable({ apis: ['setTimeout', 'Date'] });
  const fn = context.mock.fn();
  setTimeout(fn, 1000);
  setTimeout(fn, 2000);
  setTimeout(fn, 3000);

  context.mock.timers.runAll();
  // All timers are executed as the time is now reached
  assert.strictEqual(fn.mock.callCount(), 3);
  assert.strictEqual(Date.now(), 3000);
});
```

```cjs
const assert = require('node:assert');
const { test } = require('node:test');

test('runs timers as setTime passes ticks', (context) => {
  // Optionally choose what to mock
  context.mock.timers.enable({ apis: ['setTimeout', 'Date'] });
  const fn = context.mock.fn();
  setTimeout(fn, 1000);
  setTimeout(fn, 2000);
  setTimeout(fn, 3000);

  context.mock.timers.runAll();
  // All timers are executed as the time is now reached
  assert.strictEqual(fn.mock.callCount(), 3);
  assert.strictEqual(Date.now(), 3000);
});
```
