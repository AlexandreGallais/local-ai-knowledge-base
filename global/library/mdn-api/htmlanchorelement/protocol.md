# HTMLAnchorElement: protocol property

The **`protocol`** property of the `HTMLAnchorElement` interface is a string containing the protocol or scheme of the `` element's `href`, including the final `":"`.

This property can be set to change the protocol of the URL. A `":"` is appended to the provided string if not provided. The provided scheme has to be compatible with the rest of the URL to be considered valid.

See `URL.protocol` for more information.

## Value

A string.

## Examples

### Getting the protocol of an anchor link

```js
// An <a id="myAnchor" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/HTMLAnchorElement"> element is in the document
const anchor = document.getElementById("myAnchor");
anchor.protocol; // returns 'https:'
```
