# CSSValue: cssText property

The **`cssText`** property of the `CSSValue`
interface represents the current computed CSS property value.

> **Note:**
> This property was part of an attempt to create a typed CSS Object Model. This attempt has been abandoned, and most browsers do
> not implement it.
>
> To achieve your purpose, you can use:
>
> - the untyped CSS Object Model, widely supported, or
> - the modern CSS Typed Object Model API, less supported and considered experimental.

## Value

A string representing the current CSS property value.

## Examples

```js
const styleDeclaration = document.styleSheets[0].cssRules[0].style;
const cssValue = styleDeclaration.getPropertyCSSValue("color");
console.log(cssValue.cssText);
```

## Specifications

This feature was originally defined in the DOM Style Level 2 specification, but has been dropped from any
standardization effort since then.

It has been superseded by a modern, but incompatible, CSS Typed Object Model API that is now on the standard track.
