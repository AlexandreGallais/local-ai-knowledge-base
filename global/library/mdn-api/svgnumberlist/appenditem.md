# SVGNumberList: appendItem() method

The **`appendItem()`** method of the `SVGNumberList` interface inserts a new item at the end of the list. If the given item is already in a list, it is removed from its previous list before it is inserted into this list. The inserted item is the item itself and not a copy.

## Syntax

```js
appendItem(newItem)
```

### Parameters

- `newItem`
    The `SVGNumber` to add to the list.

### Return value

The `SVGNumber` that was added to the list.

### Exceptions

- `NoModificationAllowedError` `DOMException`
    Thrown if the `SVGNumberList` corresponds to a read-only attribute or when the object itself is read-only.
