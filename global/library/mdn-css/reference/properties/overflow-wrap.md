# `overflow-wrap` CSS property

The **`overflow-wrap`** CSS property applies to text, setting whether the browser should insert line breaks within an otherwise unbreakable string to prevent text from overflowing its line box.

> **Note:**
> The property was originally a nonstandard and unprefixed Microsoft extension called `word-wrap`, and was implemented by most browsers with the same name. It has since been renamed to `overflow-wrap`, with `word-wrap` being an alias.

```css
overflow-wrap: normal;
```

```css
overflow-wrap: anywhere;
```

```css
overflow-wrap: break-word;
```

```html
<section class="default-example" id="default-example">
  <div class="example-container">
    Most words are short &amp; don't need to break. But
    <strong class="transition-all" id="example-element"
      >Antidisestablishmentarianism</strong
    >
    is long. The width is set to min-content, with a max-width of 11em.
  </div>
</section>
```

```css
.example-container {
  background-color: rgb(255 0 200 / 0.2);
  border: 3px solid rebeccapurple;
  padding: 0.75em;
  width: min-content;
  max-width: 11em;
  height: 200px;
}
```

> **Note:**
> In contrast to `word-break`, `overflow-wrap` will only create a break if an entire word cannot be placed on its own line without overflowing.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
overflow-wrap: normal;
overflow-wrap: break-word;
overflow-wrap: anywhere;

/* Global values */
overflow-wrap: inherit;
overflow-wrap: initial;
overflow-wrap: revert;
overflow-wrap: revert-layer;
overflow-wrap: unset;
```

### Values

This property is specified as one of the following keyword values:

- `normal`
    Lines may only break at normal word break points (such as a space between two words).
- `anywhere`
    To prevent overflow, an otherwise unbreakable string of characters — like a long word or URL — may be broken at any point if there are no otherwise-acceptable break points in the line. No hyphenation character is inserted at the break point. Soft wrap opportunities introduced by the word break are considered when calculating min-content intrinsic sizes.
- `break-word`
    The same as the `anywhere` value, with normally unbreakable words allowed to be broken at arbitrary points if there are no otherwise acceptable break points in the line, but soft wrap opportunities introduced by the word break are NOT considered when calculating min-content intrinsic sizes.

## Examples

### Comparing overflow-wrap, word-break, and hyphens
